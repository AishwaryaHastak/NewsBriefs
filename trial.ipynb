Their bodies are still in Gaza.\\xa0Cooper, Metzger, and Peri were seen in\\xa0a video released by Hamas under the title, \"Don’t let us grow old here.\" In the video, the three men appear gaunt, wearing thin white T-shirts.\"We are the generation who built the foundation for the state of Israel,\" Haim Peri says, noting that all the men have chronic illnesses. \"We do not understand why we have been abandoned here.\"The IDF said Monday that the family members of the victims have been informed of their deaths.\\xa0\"The decision to pronounce the four hostages dead was based on intelligence and was confirmed by a Ministry of Health expert committee, in coordination with the Ministry of Religious Services and the Chief Rabbi of Israel,\" an IDF spokesperson said. \"The circumstances of their death in Hamas captivity are still under examination by all the relevant professionals.\"\\xa0Hamas claimed in May that the other hostage pronounced deceased, Nadav Popplewell, died after being wounded in an Israeli airstrike, but provided no evidence to that effect. Popplewell was 51.Monday’s\\xa0announcement heightens pressure on the Israeli government to agree to a U.S. cease-fire proposal that could secure the return of the hostages still held in Gaza and end the eight-month war.MALDIVES BANS ISRAELIS FROM ENTERING COUNTRY DURING WAR IN GAZAAbout 80 hostages in Gaza are believed to be alive, alongside the remains of 43 others. In the days since the Biden administration announced the cease-fire proposal on Friday, Israel has seen some of its largest protests calling on the government to bring them home. Israeli leadership has appeared to brush aside President Biden\\'s proposal, vowing to keep conducting military operations against Hamas until the militant group is destroyed.About 100 captives were released during a week long exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners in November. Three of the men declared dead Monday had female relatives who were released during the exchange.Cooper was an economist and one of the founders of kibbutz Nir Oz, according to the hostages forum. Metzger helped to found the kibbutz winery and Peri built the community\\'s art gallery and sculpture garden.Nir Oz was among the hardest-hit towns near the border with Gaza during the Hamas attack Oct. 7, when Palestinian militants stormed Israel, killing some 1,200 people and hauling around 250 hostages back to Gaza.Israeli bombardments and ground operations in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\\'s Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.Israel has been expanding its offensive in the southern city of Rafah, once the main hub of humanitarian aid operations. The Israeli invasion of Rafah has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians facing widespread hunger.'},\n",

The prosecutor’s office is demanding that they be charged with \"premeditated violence,\" an offense that carries a three-year sentence and a $48,997 fine, the officials told The Associated Press.FRANCE FILES PRELIMINARY TERRORISM CHARGES AGAINST TEENAGER ACCUSED OF PLAN TO ATTACK OLYMPIC FANSPlacing coffins at the foot of the Paris landmark that millions of tourists visit every year, \"is considered an act of psychological violence,\" they said. It caused employees of the landmark and others \"an inability to work,\" the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of a pending investigation.The motive for the incident was unclear.France is on its highest alert level ahead of the July 26-August 11 Summer Games in Paris and the lavish open-air ceremony on the River Seine.On Friday, French authorities raised preliminary terrorism charges against an 18-year-old accused of plotting to target spectators at the soccer games at the Paris Olympics. It was the first such thwarted plot targeting the Games, which start in eight weeks.Those arrested in the Eiffel Tower incident include the driver of the vehicle that transported the coffins, a 39-year-old Bulgarian, as well as two people associated with him — a 25-year-old German man and a 16-year-old Ukrainian, who was arrested aboard a Paris-Berlin bound Flixbus, the officials said.The Olympic rings will be displayed on the Eiffel Tower. The Olympic and Paralympic medals in Paris are being embedded with pieces from a hexagonal chunk of iron taken from the 95-foot-long and 49-foot-high monument.'},\n",

It\\'s been neglected for around 20 years or even longer. And we feed the people, you know,\" French farmer Sylvain Fourriques, 39, said.At the Catalan border with France, farmers played soccer and cooked paellas while blocking crossings, creating long queues of cars and trucks.\"While thousands of truck drivers remain blocked on many roads without being able to get out or even eat..., farmers calmly prepare to eat a good paella. And where are the police?\" Spanish transport association Fenadismer, which estimates 20,000 trucks cross the border with France each day, said on X.The European Parliament election begins on Thursday, although most countries will cast their ballots on Sunday.'}]"

              "'UK plan to deport terror suspects\\n\\nDeals are being sought to allow the UK to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death.\\n\\nHome Secretary Charles Clarke told the Times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. The move follows a Law Lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at Belmarsh prison, London, and Woodhill, Milton Keynes, was unlawful. The 12 affected by the ruling are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. The government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 September to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.\\n\\nMr Clarke told The Times: \"I think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come.\" He said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw \"in a very positive way\". Mr Clarke said that he was seeking \"memorandums of understanding\" between overseas governments and Britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. However, he added: \"I do not think the solution to the Law Lords\\' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help. \"There are other strands that we have to do.\" But the Liberal Democrat\\'s shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.\\n\\n\"The critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,\" he told BBC News. \"And I do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included,\" Mr Oaten said. \"Deportation may tackle this initial problem but I want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.\" \"Unless we get that, the Liberal Democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in March.\"\\n\\nThe BBC\\'s home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett. But he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees\\' home countries could be difficult. \"Some of these people are accused of very, very serious crimes in their home countries so it\\'s not an easy agreement to get and I think for some of these suspects it won\\'t be the solution.\" Daniel Sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks. \"The government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial,\" he said.\\n'"

            "{'title': 'Android banking trojan masquerades as Google Play to steal your data', 'description': 'New malware poses as a Google Play update with the intention of stealing data from Android users. Kurt “CyberGuy\" Knutsson discusses how to protect yourself.', 'content': 'Criminals constantly develop new ways to scam people, and their latest tactic involves infecting Android phones with malware to access banking information and other details. Researchers at the cybersecurity firm Cyble have discovered a new malware, dubbed Antidot, which masquerades as a Google Play update application. It displays fake Google Play update pages in multiple languages and captures sensitive information.GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HEREAs detailed by Cyble, Antidote is a Trojan – malware that misleads users of its true intent by disguising itself as a standard program. In this case, it impersonates the Google Play Store (the default app market for downloading and updating apps on Android phones) and captures your important data.Antidot enters your Android phone by tricking you into sideloading it as an APK (Android Package Kit). APK is the file format that Android uses to distribute and install applications. When you sideload an app, you’re manually installing an APK file on your Android device, which is not obtained through the Google Play Store. You won’t find it on the Play Store because Google makes sure to keep most of the malicious apps off its platform. However, you may come across it on third-party app stores or other less legitimate sources.The malware can also enter your phone through phishing emails and text messages. For example, you might receive an email claiming you’ve won something (a lottery, a phone, etc.). You open the email and click on the link, and either nothing happens or you are taken to a dummy site. However, malware has been downloaded and installed on your phone.VOICE CLONING IS THE NEW WEAPON IN SCAMMERS’ ARSENAL FOR FAMILY EMERGENCY SCHEMESOnce the malware is installed on your Android phone, it displays a fake update page featuring a \"Continue\" button that takes you to the Accessibility settings. Antidot relies on the Accessibility services to carry out its malicious activities as they allow it to gain complete control over your phone.The trojan displays fake update pages in various languages, including German, French, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Romanian and English, indicating that it is targeting Android users in these language-speaking regions.SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICESAfter gaining access to your phone’s accessibility settings, it can access whatever information it wants, whether it’s collecting contacts and text messages, harvesting credentials, locking and unlocking the device, or forwarding calls.To steal passwords and other credentials, Antidot uses a sneaky trick called an overlay attack. When you open your bank app on your phone, the malware loads a fake website that looks exactly like the real bank app and covers it up. When you type in your login details, the hackers capture them, and they can then steal your money, commit fraud or even steal your identity with enough information.If the malware doesn’t have a fake website for an app, it uses another trick called \"keylogging,\" which captures everything you type on your Android smartphone, including your passwords.‘UNSUBSCRIBE’ EMAIL SCAM IS TARGETING AMERICANSWhile a trojan is hard to detect and can be dangerous once it enters your phone, there are several things you can do to protect your data.1) Be cautious of phishing attempts: Be vigilant about emails, phone calls or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request.2) Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but it’s not enough to stop all malicious software. Historically, Play Protect hasn’t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\\'s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device.4) Use an identity theft protection service: Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\\xa0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.5) Monitor your accounts: If you think you have been affected by the banking trojan, regularly review your bank statements, credit card statements and other financial accounts for any unauthorized activity. If you notice any suspicious transactions, report them immediately to your bank or credit card company.6) Enable SMS notifications for your bank accounts: By enabling SMS notifications, you can monitor your accounts for any unauthorized transactions.7) Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): 2FA is an extra shield that prevents hackers from accessing your accounts.\\xa08) Use a password manager: A password manager can help you create and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, reducing the risk of password theft.9) Regularly update your device’s operating system and apps: Keeping your software up to date is crucial as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by trojans.10) Be wary of granting permissions: Carefully review the permissions requested by apps. If an app asks for more access than it needs for its functionality, it could be a red flag.ANDROID USERS AT RISK AS BANKING TROJAN TARGETS MORE APPSStaying one step ahead of cybercriminals is a constant challenge. The emergence of the Antidot trojan is a stark reminder that our vigilance must be as innovative as the threats we face. It’s not just about safeguarding our devices; it’s about protecting our digital existence. Remember, the power to prevent such intrusions largely rests in our hands. By adopting the protective measures outlined, from scrutinizing every app’s permissions to embracing robust security solutions, we can fortify our digital fortresses.

Google\\'s AI figured prominently in the conference.', 'content': 'Google\\'s flagship developer conference called I/O just wrapped up with interesting leaps in how the Big Tech giant is planning to change the world.Here are the seven biggest things we learned from Google at I/O 2024.Google\\'s I/O event was largely an opportunity for it to make its case to developers — and, to a lesser extent, consumers — as to why its artificial intelligence is ahead of rivals Microsoft and OpenAI. Here\\'s a rundown of the seven highlights to keep an eye on. Google\\'s AI, named Gemini, was featured prominently at the I/O conference and is now available to developers worldwide.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTERAccording to the conference, Gemini is now capable of pulling information from text, photos, audio, web pages and live videos from your phone\\'s camera and is able to synthesize the information it receives and answer questions you may have about it. Here\\'s what the Gemini improvements look like in practice.Google showed a demo for its phone call scam detection feature, which the company says will be coming to a future version of Android. How it works is revolutionary and concerning. The feature will scan voice calls as they occur in real time, and it’s already drawing enormous privacy concerns. It would be like allowing your phone calls to be tapped and monitored by Big Tech instead of Big Brother.However, Google says, \"This protection all happens on device, so your conversation stays private to you. This means that you will have the choice to turn this feature on, and if you have it on, your conversation doesn\\'t leave your device since the AI protection works directly on your device, so it\\'s impossible for Google or anyone else to hear it.\"Apple had planned a similar feature on iOS back in 2021 but abandoned it after backlash from privacy advocates. Google is under similar pressure, with privacy advocates worried that the company notorious for harvesting and profiting from personal data might soon misuse AI voice scanning technology.IS THE FTC CALLING YOU? PROBABLY NOT. HERE\\'S HOW TO AVOID A NEW PHONE SCAM TARGETING YOUGoogle unveiled a new feature called Ask Photos, in which users can ask Gemini to search for their photos and deliver exact results. One example showcased was the use of Gemini to locate images of your car in your photo album by telling it your license plate number.QUICK TIPS. EXPERT INSIGHTS. CLICK TO GET THE FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTERStarting immediately, Google has added a button to toggle Gemini AI in the side panel of several of its Google Suite apps, including Gmail, Google Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides. Similar to Microsoft\\'s Co-Pilot AI function, the Gemini button can help answer questions, craft emails and provide summaries of documents and email threads.HOW TO CREATE A CUSTOM GMAIL SIGNATUREWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?On a more experimental note, Google also unveiled its VideoFX feature, a generative video model based on Google\\'s DeepMind video generator, Veo. VideoFX can create Full HD (1080p) videos from text prompts, and we also saw improvements made to ImageFX, Google\\'s high-resolution AI image generator.For musicians, Google also showed their new DJ Mode in MusicFX, an AI music generator that can be used to create loops and samples from prompts.QUICK TIPS. EXPERT INSIGHTS. CLICK TO GET THE FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTERGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREThere\\'s been a lot of press lately regarding how difficult searching for things on Google has become. Constant changes to search engine optimization as well as a new wave of bots and AI-created content has disrupted the once monolithic search engine. However, Google showed off its new AI-organized search, which promises more readable search results.Google also showed off how it is using AI to create overviews, which are short summaries to help you answer questions posed in the search box. These summaries will appear at the top of the search results page, so you don\\'t even need to visit another website to get answers you may be looking for.Google managed to work its Gemini AI into its Google TV smart TV operating system, allowing it to generate descriptions for movies and TV shows. When you are viewing content that is missing a description, Gemini will fill it in automatically. Gemini on Google TV will also now translate descriptions into the viewers\\' native language, making it easier to find international shows and movies to watch.HOW TO DELETE EVERYTHING FROM YOUR GOOGLE SEARCHESGoogle also unveiled LearnLM, a new generative AI model that is designed for education.

The wording suggests the company didn’t have direct access to the leaked database. Still, the post revealed plenty of information about the incident and the threat actors behind the attack.The hacking groups EquationCorp and USDoD are reportedly responsible for a major data breach involving the criminal record database. The breach, which resulted in the online leak of the database, contains 70 million entries. It includes the full names, dates of birth, known aliases, addresses, arrest and conviction dates, sentences and other information of millions of Americans who had encounters with the U.S. justice system between 2020 and 2024.We contacted Malwarebytes and spoke with Pieter Arntz, a security researcher at the company, who informed us that they were able to obtain a small sample of the criminal records, which are specific to individual incidents. Each entry represents either an arrest or a case rather than a comprehensive compilation of all crimes committed by a single person. In other words, these records provide a snapshot of discrete legal events rather than a comprehensive overview of an individual’s criminal history.\\xa0The exact source of this database is unknown. However, the hacker group USDoD, a major player in the field, is closely linked to \"Pompompurin,\" the operator of the original data leak site BreachForums. According to Malwarebytes, USDoD plans to create a successor to the second version of BreachForums, which was recently shut down by law enforcement. By releasing this database, USDoD might be trying to attract new users.The same hacker is also believed to be involved in a breach at TransUnion, the data from which was partly dumped in September 2023.MASSIVE DELL DATA BREACH HITS 49 MILLION USERS — WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR PRIVACY AND SECURITYIf you\\'ve had a run-in with the law before, there\\'s a good chance that a bunch of the info you shared with law enforcement is now out there on the web. The exposure of such a comprehensive criminal database could have significant implications for law enforcement, judicial proceedings and the individuals mentioned within the dataset.The hackers who pulled off the leak might be looking to make a quick buck by selling your data to shady characters on the dark web. They might also try to con you by pretending to be someone you trust or a legit company, aiming to get their hands on some cash.This much bulk data can also be used by bad actors to threaten, harass and blackmail people with records similar to the Ashley Madison breach. For the unaware, In July 2015, a hacker group calling itself \"The Impact Team\" stole the user data of Ashley Madison, a commercial website billed as enabling extramarital affairs. These hackers copied personal information from the user base and threatened to expose users\\' names and personal details unless Ashley Madison shut down right away.WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?SNEAKY SPYWARE IS AFTER YOUR MOST SENSITIVE DATAIf you suspect you\\'ve been impacted by this data breach, follow these steps to protect your personal data and privacy.1. Invest in identity theft protection: If you think your personal data has been leaked, scammers may try to impersonate you to gain access to your private information. The best thing you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service.Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.\\xa02. Place a fraud alert: Contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file.

Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request.The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices.

Check Social Security benefits: It is crucial to periodically check your Social Security benefits to ensure they have not been tampered with or altered in any way, safeguarding your financial security and preventing potential fraud.\\xa05. Invest in removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for removal services here.6. Change your password: You can render a stolen password useless to thieves simply by changing it. Opt for a strong password — one you don\\'t use elsewhere. Even better, consider letting a password manager generate one for you.AT&T DATA LEAK FROM 73 MILLION CUSTOMERS — WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NEXTThe fact that threat actors were able to leak such a comprehensive amount of data suggests serious loopholes in government systems.

These powerful tools are essential for safeguarding your online activities and maintaining privacy against ever-evolving cyberthreats. Despite widespread recognition of their benefits, many users, like Beth, who recently contacted us, encounter challenges in effectively leveraging VPNs.\"Hi. I recently had some jerk hack my Amazon account and cause all sorts of problems and I believe they also hacked my Etsy account. … Anyway, I wanted to start using a VPN since 99% of my time both for work and at home is spent online and the same for my son and my husband. However, we noticed that a HUGE number of sites want to block people who are using VPNs. Do you have a suggestion for a VPN that is less likely to be blocked or noticed or however that works?\" —\\xa0Beth, Verbena, AlabamaHey Beth, I’m sorry to hear that you had to go through such an ordeal. It’s understandable that you want to protect your online privacy and security by using a VPN. However, it’s true that some websites block VPN connections to prevent fraudulent activities and protect their own security. Below are the reasons why VPN connections are blocked and how to circumvent that.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE NEWSLETTER, THE CYBERGUY REPORTMajor paid VPN services invest significant resources into evading VPN blocking by websites and services. Their server networks are large and constantly rotating IP addresses, making it harder to blacklist.Free VPN services tend to have smaller server networks and get their IP address ranges blacklisted more easily by anti-VPN measures. Paid providers are generally better at bypassing blocks.Many VPNs offer an obfuscation or camouflage mode that disguises VPN traffic as regular internet traffic, helping evade deep packet inspection used to identify VPNs.Some VPN providers offer browser extensions that can sometimes bypass VPN blocks when the desktop app fails. The extensions route only the browser traffic through the VPN.No VPN is 100% unblockable, but following these tips can help find a service that minimizes the chances of being blocked when trying to access restricted websites and services.MORE: HOW TO USE VPNs WITHOUT COMPROMISING YOUR BANKING APPSRegarding your online privacy, it’s true that companies like Google have been caught taking information they were not given permission to access. However, it’s important to note that websites have the right to block VPN connections if they suspect fraudulent activities. This is because VPNs can be used to mask the identity of the user and bypass geographical restrictions, which can be used for illegal activities. Below are the top four reasons VPN connections are blocked.1) Transparency: Financial institutions, in particular, often block VPNs because they want to preserve the transparency of transactions. In short, these institutions have a vested interest in seeing where and who the funds are coming and going. PayPal actually will go as far as to ban VPN users for life as it violates their Terms of Service agreements.2) Limiting services: Streaming services do not want users to use VPN because it bypasses specific region-based restrictions. Certain content is only available to specific regions of the world, and VPN would mask the user\\'s location.\\xa0Streaming services actively block VPN IP addresses, and if it is discovered you managed to bypass their IP blacklists with a regular VPN or VPN obfuscation, you can come under \"fire\" from the streaming services.3) Preventing illegal activities: Some governments and companies utilize VPN blocking to ensure that they are protected against misuse, fraud, and other illegal activities.4) Control: Some governments and companies use VPN blocking to monitor and trace back activities by individuals online. For instance, some companies ban VPN use, limiting nonwork access online, etc.ASK ANY TECH QUESTION AND GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER HEREMORE: HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOT SPOT PRIVACY, SECURITY WITH VPNOne effective way to bypass VPN blocking is to connect to a different VPN server location or city. Many websites and services that attempt to block VPNs do so by blacklisting known VPN IP address ranges. By switching to a VPN server in a different city or country, you can obtain a new IP address that may not be blocked.Most reputable VPN providers have a large global server network spanning hundreds or thousands of servers across dozens of countries. This gives you many options to try different server locations until you find one that is not blocked by the website or service you\\'re trying to access.The steps are usually:By changing your virtual location frequently, you make it much harder for anti-VPN measures to keep up with blacklisting all the IP addresses associated with a particular VPN service.Consider using a VPN to protect against being tracked and to identify your potential location on websites that you visit.\\xa0Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location.

Unfortunately, some companies and government agencies block VPN users, which is completely legal.

In this particular scam, scammers send their victims phishing emails pretending to send them a large invoice for their Geek Squad subscription. The email recipients usually panic at the large charge and call the customer service telephone number listed in the scam email and invoice.\\xa0The scammer then pretends to be the customer service representative helping to cancel or refund the charge. They’ll usually use that moment as an opportunity to confirm bank account information with the victim to steal their money later. Even if you simply click on their links or download the invoice from the email, there is a potential risk that viruses or malware have been downloaded onto your device.\\xa0MORE: THE ‘UNSUBSCRIBE’ EMAIL SCAM IS TARGETING AMERICANSThe elderly victim gave her bank account number and remote access to her computer.

This is when the elderly woman called her local authorities.

Invoices, for better or worse, come regularly and on a consistent schedule. If something shows up in an unusual form (an email instead of a letter in the mail per usual) or at a particular time, you are more likely to stop yourself from falling for this type of scam.Go to the official website for contact information. If the scammers happen to pick a company that you do subscribe to, it can be even easier to fall for this type of scam. But before clicking any links, downloading any invoices or calling the number listed, you can google the company’s official website and use the contact information there. If the company did indeed send you a bill, they should be able to help you with the refund or confirm whether you were sent legitimate communications.Watch for language and tone of voice: Most legitimate companies go out of their way to specially train their employees to provide their customers with excellent service. They are trained not to lose their temper, so if you happen to be on a call with a scammer, they often don’t use professional language or have a professional demeanor. If you push back on providing certain information, a real customer service agent wouldn’t make any threats or demands. Providing Social Security numbers or bank account information is usually frowned upon for security reasons by legitimate companies. Legitimate companies typically have other ways to validate your identity and account information. You can always hang up the phone if you get overwhelmed on a call!

Change passwords: For any accounts that might have been accessed or mentioned to or by the scammer, you should log in from a secure, virus- and malware-free device and change your password immediately. It is best to create unique and complex passwords, including letters, symbols and numbers, for each separate online account. If you need help generating and storing complex passwords, consider using a password manager.2. Keep an eye on all your accounts and credit consistently: Contact the financial institution and explain the situation for all accounts impacted by the potential scammer. They can help you freeze or lock your account, so these scammers have little or no access to your money. Contact the three main credit bureaus to freeze your credit. This will prevent anyone, including hackers, from wreaking havoc on your credit. Make sure to report any errors on your credit reports with the credit agencies. Remember that you are allowed a free annual credit report. If there are too many accounts for you to keep track of regularly, a credit monitoring service can help by constantly monitoring and alerting you of any account changes or problems.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE3. Setup alerts for financial accounts: Most financial institutions offer financial alerts or restrictions for all transactions for checking accounts and cards. Do use them so you can be notified of any fraudulent transactions immediately. The faster you can report these charges to your financial institution, the more likely you can stop the scammers in their tracks.4. Enable two-factor authentication for any account impacted by the phishing scam: This would include your financial accounts and email address. If you have this additional layer of security on, the hacker or scammer would have to send a code to another device or account to gain access, even with your password.\\xa05.

They continually monitor the dark web and your financial accounts to see if any crucial personal information like your email addresses or bank account information is compromised or up for sale on the dark web.

Kyiv has sent invitations to some 160 capitals and organizations in total.Ukraine\\'s main ally, the United States, will be represented but has not said whether President Joe Biden will attend. Zelenskiy has said Russian President Vladimir Putin will be delighted if Biden misses the summit.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the summit would be \"absolutely futile\" without Russia\\'s participation.Kyiv decided against inviting Russia because it does not trust Moscow, whose invasion has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people, uprooted millions more and devastated Ukrainian towns and cities. Russian forces currently control about 18% of Ukrainian territory.Ukraine has said Moscow could be invited to a future summit to discuss an end to its invasion, but on Kyiv\\'s terms.Zelenskiy, who had lobbied China hard to take part, accused Beijing this week of helping Moscow to undermine the summit. China\\'s Foreign Ministry denied the accusation.Serhiy Nikiforov, the presidential spokesperson, said the talks, building on Zelenskiy\\'s 10-point peace formula, would prioritize three key themes - food security, nuclear safety and the release of all prisoners and deportees.\"Precisely these three points have potential to unite countries with different views,\" Nikiforov told Ukrainian TV.Zelenskiy first announced his 10-point peace formula at a summit of the Group of 20 major economies in November 2022. It also includes restoring Ukraine\\'s territorial integrity, a total withdrawal of Russian troops and the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes.Kyiv expects a communique on the results of the summit to be issued.The first talks between Ukraine and Russia took place in the early days of Russia\\'s invasion. The delegations met in Belarus and then in March 2022 in Istanbul, but broke down.During 2022 and 2023, separate peace initiatives were announced by China, the Vatican and a group of African countries, but also to no avail.In September 2022, Zelenskiy signed a decree banning any talks with Putin.

Critics say the measure may have been driven by Moscow to thwart Georgia’s chances of further integrating with the West.Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze on Monday again dismissed the criticism as \"unnecessary emotions that had only an artificial basis.\"\"Now the law has already come into force and we all have to act pragmatically, with a cool mind and put aside unnecessary emotions,\" he said.Over the weekend, the opposition United National Movement said that a crowd of masked men attacked its central offices in Tbilisi, smashing windows and damaging property. It alleged that the attackers were linked to the ruling party. The Interior Ministry has opened a probe on charges of property damage.The controversial legislation is nearly identical to one that the ruling party was pressured to withdraw last year after massive street protests. Renewed demonstrations again gripped Georgia as the bill made its way through parliament this time. Demonstrators scuffled with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them.Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, reaffirmed after signing the bill that its main purpose is to \"increase the resistance of the political, economic and social systems of Georgia to external interference.\" \"If non-governmental organizations and mass media want to participate in the decision-making process and influence the life of the Georgian people with funding from foreign governments, they must meet the minimum standard of transparency — the public must know who is behind each actor,\" he said.Georgia’s Civil Society Foundation, a non-government group, said Thursday that it was preparing to challenge the legislation in the country\\'s constitutional court.The European Union’s foreign policy arm has said that adoption of the law \"negatively impacts Georgia’s progress on the EU path.\"The EU offered Georgia candidate status last December, while making it clear that Tbilisi needs to implement key policy recommendations for its membership bid to progress.Following parliamentary approval of the bill last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials \"who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia.\" He voiced hope that the Georgian government will reverse course and \"take steps to move forward with their nation’s democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\"The opposition United National Movement has described the bill as part of efforts by Georgian Dream to drag the country into Russia’s sphere of influence — claims the ruling party angrily rejects. Georgian Dream was founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire who made his fortune in Russia.Russia-Georgia relations have often been rocky since Georgia became independent after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.In 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow then recognized South Ossetia and another separatist province, Abkhazia, as independent states and strengthened its military presence there.

In an address to the forum Saturday, Austin said that \"Putin’s war of aggression has provided us all with a preview of a world that none of us would want.\"Marcos, whose country has had escalating clashes with China over disputed islets in the South China Sea, bluntly underscored the dangers of the regional flashpoint Friday at the defense forum. He said that if \"a willful act\" should result in a Filipino dying in the high-seas hostilities, \"that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\"\"That would certainly increase the level of response,\" Marcos said in response to a question.\"Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions,\" Marcos said, without naming China, but he added that the Philippines remains committed to a peaceful resolution of the disputes.Austin said at the forum that the U.S. commitment to the Philippines as a treaty ally is \"ironclad\" but reiterated the importance of dialogue with China.\"There are a number of things that can happen at sea or in the air, we recognize that,\" he said. \"But our goal is to make sure that we don’t allow things to spiral out of control unnecessarily.\"'}\n",

The ban has particularly affected Japanese scallop growers and exporters to China.Yasukuni Shrine honors about 2.5 million Japanese war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression during the first half of the 20th century, especially China and the Koreas, see the shrine as a symbol of Japanese militarism.

Each was aimed at speaking out for those who cannot.The 1989 crackdown, in which government troops opened fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, dead, remains a taboo subject in mainland China. In Hong Kong, once a beacon of commemorative freedom, the massive June 4 annual vigil that mourned the victims for decades has vanished, a casualty of the city’s clampdown on dissidents following huge anti-government protests in 2019.He was still reeling from the loss of her academic position after Hong Kong authorities last year rejected her visa renewal, widely seen as a sign of the financial hub’s decline in intellectual freedom. Despite the exhausting schedule of talks, the former protester in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in 1989 viewed this as her duty.HONG KONG CONVICTS 14 PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS IN LANDMARK NATIONAL SECURITY CASE\"We cannot light the candles in Hong Kong anymore. So we would light it everywhere, globally,\" she said.As Beijing’s toughened political stance effectively extinguished any large-scale commemorations within its borders, overseas commemorative events have grown increasingly crucial for preserving memories of the Tiananmen crackdown. Over the past few years, a growing number of talks, rallies, exhibitions and plays on the subject have emerged in the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.These activities foster hope and counteract the aggressive efforts to erase reminders of the crackdown, particularly those seen in Hong Kong. In 2021, the city’s police charged three leaders of the group that organized the vigil with subversion under a 2020 sweeping national security law that has all but wiped out public dissent. Later, the group voted to disband. Tiananmen-related statues were also removed from universities.Last week, under a new, home-grown security law, Hong Kong police arrested seven people on suspicion of alleged sedition over their posting of social media content about commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown. A Christian newspaper, which typically publishes content related to the event ahead of its anniversary, left its front page mostly blank. It said it could only turn words into blank squares and white space to respond to the current situation.On Tuesday, the park that used to hold the vigil will be occupied by a carnival held by pro-Beijing groups.However, attempts to silence commemorative efforts have failed to erase the harrowing memories from the minds of a generation of liberal-minded Chinese in the years after tanks rolled into the heart of Beijing to break up weeks of student-led protests that had spread to other cities and were seen as a threat to Communist Party rule.He, who was 17 years old at the time, recalls that protesters like her took to the streets out of love for their country. When the crackdown happened, she spent the entire night in front of her TV, unable to sleep. After she returned to school, she was required to recite the official narrative — that the government had successfully quelled a riot — in order to pass her exams.\"I never killed anyone. But I lived with that survivor’s guilt all those years,\" she said.To preserve memories of the event, a museum dedicated to the Tiananmen crackdown opened in New York last June. It features exhibits such as a blood-stained shirt and a tent used by student protesters.A similar museum operated by vigil organizers was shuttered in Hong Kong in 2021.As of early May, its board chair Wang Dan, also a leading former student leader of the Tiananmen protests, estimated the New York museum attracted about 1,000 people, including Chinese immigrants, U.S. citizens and Hong Kongers. To expand its audience, Wang said he plans to organize temporary exhibitions on university campuses in the U.S., and possibly in other countries over the longer term.He said overseas memorial events are crucial because mainland Chinese and Hong Kongers can see overseas memorial activities online.\"It can have an effect in mainland China because young people there all know how to use VPNs to circumvent internet censorship,\" he said.Aline Sierp, a professor of European history and memory studies at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, said overseas commemorative activities allow the memories to travel and endure, providing access for other people and future generations.But she said it can be \"a double-edged sword\" because adapting the memories to new places might risk fragmenting or de-contextualizing them in the future.Alison Landsberg, a memory studies scholar at George Mason University in Virginia, said that overseas efforts carry the potential to inspire people from other places who are facing their own challenges in the pursuit of democracy.To carry the memories forward, film and television dramas can be powerful tools for people to take on memories of events through which they didn’t live, she said.She said overseas theater productions about the crackdown, which began last year in Taiwan and continued in London this year, have a greater possibility of making those connections and potentially reaching a broader audience.\"When you have a dramatic narrative, you have the capacity to bring the viewer into the story in a kind of intimate way,\" Landsberg said.Last week, members of an audience at a London theater were visibly moved, some to tears, after watching the play \"May 35th,\" a title that subtly references the June 4 crackdown.The play, produced by Lit Ming-wai, part of the Hong Kong diaspora who moved to the U.K. after the enactment of the 2020 security law, tells the story of an elderly couple who wish to properly mourn their son who died in 1989.Its director, Kim Pearce, who was born in the U.K. in the 1980s, said the tragedy had resonated with her from a young age and she was once moved to tears when she read the poem \"Tiananmen\" by James Fenton. Working on this project, she said, has further deepened her connection to the stories.British theater-goer Sue Thomas, 64, also found the play deeply moving. \"Particularly as a parent myself now, which I wasn’t then, which sort of made me think of it in a much more sort of heartfelt way,\" she said.At the theater, He, the scholar, served as one of the post-show speakers, sharing her struggles and the motivations behind her work with the audience. She said the play was so powerful that it made her relive the trauma of the past 35 years, leaving her in tears and causing her to lose her contact lenses.\"It shows that how much sufferings that people had to endure all these years,\" she said. \"If there’s anything we can do, I hope that we would bring the younger generation to understand this.\"'}\n",

No dangerous substances were said to be included.Despite the South\\'s claims that only about 1,000 balloons were launched, North Korea\\'s vice defense minister said 3,500 balloons were launched carrying 15 tons of waste.NORTH KOREA ISSUES NUCLEAR \\'WARNING SIGNAL\\' TO US, SOUTH KOREAChang Ho-jin, South Korea’s national security director, said Sunday that the government decided to take \"unbearable\" measures against North Korea in retaliation for balloon launches, alleged jamming of GPS navigational signals in South Korea and simulation of nuclear strikes against the South.Experts say North Korea’s balloon campaign, reportedly the first of its kind in seven years, is meant to stoke an internal divide in South Korea over its conservative government’s tough policy on the North.Animosity between the Koreas is at its worst level in years as the pace of both Kim\\'s weapons demonstrations and South Korea’s combined military exercises with the U.S. and Japan have intensified since 2022.The failed satellite launch was a setback to Kim’s plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 after North Korea’s first military reconnaissance satellite was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed attempts.JUSTICE DEPT MAKES ARRESTS IN NORTH KOREA IDENTITY THEFT SCHEME INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF IT WORKERSNorth Korea has maintained that it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles in the face of what it perceives as U.S.-led military threats. Kim has described spy satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhancing the threat posed by his nuclear-capable missiles.\"Given the fact that the security environment for our state is undergoing drastic changes owing to U.S. military maneuvers and provocations of all sorts, possessing military reconnaissance satellites presents itself as a prerequisite for our state to bolster up its self-defensive deterrent and safeguard its sovereignty and security from potential threats,\" Kim said.\"Although we failed to achieve the results we had hoped to get in the recent reconnaissance satellite launch, we must never feel scared or dispirited but make still greater efforts. It is natural that one learns more and makes greater progress after experiencing failure.\"North Korea hasn’t commented on when it would be ready to attempt a satellite launch again, which some experts say could take months.Kim has been boosting the visibility of his ties with Russia in recent months, highlighted by a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September as they align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.Kim’s meeting with Putin was held at a spaceport in the Russian Far East and came after North Korea’s consecutive failures in its attempts to launch its first spy satellite. Putin told Russian reporters at the time that Moscow was willing to help the North build satellites.The U.S. and South Korea have also accused North Korea of providing Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other military equipment to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine.The Associated Press contributed to this report.'}\n",

Doctors there said there was no indication he died as a result of the experimental transplant.MASSACHUSETTS MAN DIES 2 MONTHS AFTER BECOMING FIRST PERSON TO RECEIVE SUCCESSFUL PIG KIDNEY TRANSPLANTPisano’s heart and kidneys were failing when, in a dramatic pair of surgeries in April, doctors implanted a mechanical pump to keep her heart beating and then the pig kidney.At first she seemed to be recovering well. But Dr. Robert Montgomery, who led the transplant, said there were \"unique challenges\" to managing both the heart pump and new kidney. Her blood pressure dropped too low multiple times for optimal blood flow to the kidney.The kidney lost function until doctors no longer could justify keeping her on immune-suppressing medications, Montgomery said in a statement Friday.A recent kidney biopsy showed no signs of rejection – the biggest concern in highly experimental animal-to-human transplants – but there was \"significant injury\" from insufficient blood flow, he said. NYU will further study the explanted kidney for further insight on how it reacted inside a living person.Montgomery noted Pisano wasn\\'t a candidate for the life-prolonging heart pump while on dialysis, and her heart disease in turn barred a traditional kidney transplant.\"We are hoping to get Lisa back home to her family soon,\" he said. \"Her strength and bravery in the face of adversity inspires and drives us as we continue pursuing the hope and promise of xenotransplantation.\"Pisano told the Associated Press in April that she knew the pig kidney might not work but \"I just took a chance.

In hopes of filling the shortage of donated organs, several biotech companies are genetically modifying pigs so their organs are more humanlike, less likely to be destroyed by people’s immune system.Formal studies of such organs are expected to begin next year. Meanwhile, NYU and other research teams have temporarily transplanted pig kidneys and hearts into brain-dead bodies, with promising results.

Although the report noted that families are reporting \"high levels of satisfaction with all of the school placements.\"One email from 2022 shows a DCPS staff member from the Office of Elementary Schools warning that one school had received \"an influx of ELL [English Language Learner] students who do not speak English, and the teachers need instructional support with strategies to support our scholars.\"Another email is about the \"increased challenges with school placement for Migrant Students.\"18 DEMS VOTE IN FAVOR OF GOP-LED BILL CRACKING DOWN ON DC CRIMEThat email, from Nov. 2022, says that there is an increase of families with multiple children, with 10-12 new students in a single day.\"We are now finding that seat availability in all of the grades needed is very challenging,\" it says. \"While we were trying to keep all siblings in one school, we have had to split up several families as far as school placement (especially for families that have ES and Secondary kiddos).\"\"I reached out to several principals yesterday about placement of students in grades that are at or beyond capacity,\" the official said.CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISISThe email, from the director of Academic Programming for English Learners, describes an urgent need to add classes and staff at one school, including classroom teachers.\"We will be back at the Days Inn [where migrants were being housed] next week and expect a similar number of new students.\" With the cold temperatures and limited warm weather clothes, having a school option that is closer will be meaningful for the families.\"Another email from March 2023, said that the district was expecting another 100 students by the end of the year and asks for how \"to facilitate transportation for this District Emergency\" as they look for seat availability and how to \"proceed when we exceed class capacity.\"A chart obtained via the FOIA shows that there were 155 additional migrants in four schools and another 120 projected. A Jan. 2023 email stated that the enrollment reserve for additional staffing had already been depleted. Another chart from February 2023 showed that four schools had 70, 50, 80 and 25 migrant schools enrolled at each school and no additional capacity.While cities hit by the numbers of migrants coming to them blamed the crisis on the buses sent from Texas by Gov. Greg Abbott, Parents Defending Education said it was a consequence of a failure to enforce immigration law.\"An obvious consequence of failure to enforce immigration law is that schools will see an influx of high need students, many of whom speak a different language and have little experience with formal schooling,\" Erika Sanzi, Director of Outreach for Parents Defending Education, said in a statement.\\xa0\"It\\'s an untenable and totally predictable burden that schools are forced to carry — and it is not unique to DC.\"D.C. Public Schools did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital, but a spokesperson told Axios in October that approximately 400 students from migrant families were enrolled in schools.It is the latest sign of the ongoing strain facing cities where migrants have arrived in large numbers. In New York City, officials are considering ending the sanctuary policies that have been seen as partly responsible for the woes caused by massive migrant arrivals there.'}\n",

Of those applications, immigration judges ordered 36,250 of the applicants be removed from the U.S., granted asylum to 31,859 applicants. The other 102,550 applications were reportedly dismissed or taken off the books.In 2023, there were 248,232 asylum applications filed, of which 52,440 applicants were ordered to be removed, 43,113 were granted asylum, and 149,305 were dismissed or taken off the books.IMMIGRATION JUDGES RAMP UP PACE CLOSING DEPORTATION CASES, BUT BACKLOG EXPLODES AS BORDER CRISIS GROWSSo far in 2024, there have been 175,193 asylum applications and 113,843 applications dismissed.The numbers are much higher than under the Trump administration, when in 2019 – before the pandemic – there were 87,018 asylum applications filed with 52,223 applicants removed from the country, 24,109 granted relief and 4,746 applications dismissed.When cases are closed, migrants are no longer faced with deportation or removal proceedings. They are also not obligated to leave the U.S. as they are no longer being monitored by ICE.BIDEN'S REVERSAL OF TRUMP POLICIES CREATED BORDER CRISIS, EXPERT SAYS: 'INTENTIONALLY UNSECURED IT'The applicants whose cases are dismissed are able to apply for asylum again or they can seek out other forms of legal status like a family-based or employment-based visa, or even Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).The immigration court backlog has grown from 2.8 million at the end of Fiscal Year 2023 to nearly 3.6 million in FY 2024, with immigration judges being unable to keep up with the current flow of new cases into the system.The number of new cases filed as well as the number of cases completed by\\xa0immigration judges are both on pace to exceed all-time highs this year, the TRAC report notes, though the pace of completions will be unable to stem the growing backlog.‘FEARMONGERING’: CHINESE MIGRANT SURGE HEARING DISMISSED BY HOUSE DEMS DESPITE NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS\\xa0The president has been weighing additional executive action since the collapse of a bipartisan border bill earlier this year. The number of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico. Still, immigration remains a top concern heading into the U.S. presidential election in November and Republicans are eager to hammer Biden on the issue.The Democratic administration’s effort would aim to head off any potential spike in crossings that could occur later in the year, as the fall election draws closer, when the weather cools and numbers tend to rise. Four people familiar with Biden’s plans were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing discussions and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.The move would allow Biden, whose administration has taken smaller steps in recent weeks to discourage migration and speed up asylum processing, to say he has done all he can do to control the border numbers without help from Congress.The restrictions being considered are an aggressive attempt to ease the nation's overwhelmed asylum system, along with a new effort to speed up the cases of migrants already in America and another meant to quicken processing for migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States.The people told the AP that the administration was weighing some of the policies directly from a stalled bipartisan Senate border deal, including capping the number of encounters at an average of 4,000 per day over a week and whether that limit would include asylum-seekers coming to the border with appointments through U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s CBP One app. Right now, there are roughly 1,450 such appointments per day.Fox News Digital’s Michael Lee and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\"}\n",

They made claims of widespread voter fraud and spread conspiracy theories that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election. There has been no evidence to support such claims, but they have become embedded in many places that voted heavily for Trump.The citizen initiatives in South Dakota to prohibit tabulating machines are set to appear on Tuesday\\'s primary ballot in Gregory, Haakon and Tripp counties. Similar petition efforts for future measure votes are underway in more than 40 other counties in the conservative state, Pollema said. At least four counties have rejected attempts to force hand counting.Earlier, the Fall River County Commission voted in February to count ballots by hand for the June election, and Tripp County counted its general election ballots by hand in 2022.If the measure passes Tuesday, Gregory County Auditor Julie Bartling said the county will have to increase the number of precincts to lessen the burden of hand counting. That will force it to buy more assisted voting devices for disabled voters. The county also will face the difficult task of hiring more election workers.Bartling, who runs elections in the county, opposes the initiative and said she has \"full faith in the automated tabulators.\"Todd and Tripp County Auditor Barb DeSersa said she also opposes attempts to require hand counting of all ballots because the process isn\\'t as accurate. She said the 2022 hand count left election workers exhausted.\"I know the ones that have done it the last time didn\\'t want nothing to do with it this time, so I think once they do it once or twice, they\\'ll get tired of it, and it\\'ll be harder to find people to volunteer to do that,\" DeSersa said.DeSersa\\'s office estimated it would cost $17,000 to $25,000 for elections in Tripp County to be counted by hand, compared to about $19,000 to $21,000 using tabulators. Haakon County Auditor Stacy Pinney said she initially estimated hand counting will cost between $750 and $4,500, but \"overall, an election cost is hard to determine at this point.\"According to a state attorney\\'s analysis for Haakon County, it would take two election workers using a tabulator three to four hours to count all the ballots. It would take 15 to 20 election workers between five and 15 hours to do a hand count, depending on the number of contested races.The three counties have a combined 7,725 active registered voters, according to a statewide report.Republican state Rep. Rocky Blare, who lives in Tripp County, said he will vote against the measure.\"They can\\'t prove to me that there\\'s been any issues that I think have affected our election in South Dakota,\" Blare said.Secretary of State Monae Johnson, a Republican, expressed confidence in tabulating machines, noting they have been used for years. In a statement, she pointed to \"safeguards built in throughout the process and the post-election audit on the machines after the primary and general election to ensure they are working properly.\"The June election will be the first with a post-election audit, a process included in a 2023 state law. It involves hand counting all the votes in two races from 5% of precincts in every county to ensure the machine tabulation is accurate. Johnson\\'s office said there was no evidence of any widespread problems in 2020 or 2022. One person voted twice, she said, and was caught.After repeated attacks against machine-counting of ballots in the 2020 presidential election, Dominion Voting Systems last year reached a $787 million settlement in a defamation case against Fox News over false claims the network repeatedly aired. The judge in that case found it was \"CRYSTAL clear\" none of the claims about Dominion’s machines was true, and testimony showed many Fox hosts quietly doubted the claims their network was airing.Since 2020, only a few counties have made the switch to hand counting. In California, officials in Shasta County voted to get rid of their ballot tabulators, but state lawmakers later restricted hand counts to limited circumstances. Officials in Arizona\\'s Mohave County rejected a proposal to hand count ballots in 2023, citing the $1.1 million cost.David Levine, a former local election official in Idaho who is now a senior fellow with the Alliance for Securing Democracy, said research has shown hand counting large numbers of ballots is more costly, less accurate and takes more time than machine tabulators.\"If you listen to conspiracy theorists and election skeptics throughout the U.S., one reason the 2020 election was illegitimate was because of an algorithm. Hence, if you take computers out of the voting process, you’ll have a more secure election,\" Levine said. \"The only problem: it’s not true.\"While some areas do count ballots by hand, mainly in the Northeast, it typically happens in places with a small number of registered voters. Hand counts are common during post-election tests to check that machines are counting ballots correctly, but only a small portion of the ballots are manually checked.Election experts say it’s unrealistic to think workers in large jurisdictions, with tens or hundreds of thousands of voters, could count all their ballots by hand and report results quickly, especially since ballots often include multiple races.\"The issue is that people aren’t very good at large, tedious, repetitive tasks like counting ballots, and computers are,\" Levine said. \"Those who believe otherwise are either unaware of this reality or choose to ignore it.\"'}\n",

As the parrots soar squawking past their home, the couple can readily identify bird No. 17 by its smooth feathers and can tell No. 16 from No. 22, which has two beads attached to its radio collar.This familiarity offers a glimpse of the South African couple’s commitment to saving one of the world\\'s most critically endangered species. The parrot — endemic to a small fraction of the Sao Francisco River basin and already rare in the 19th century — was declared extinct in the wild in 2000, when a lonely surviving male disappeared following decades of poaching and habitat destruction from livestock overgrazing. The few remaining birds were scattered in private collections around the world.For the Spix\\'s macaws, immortalized in the popular animated \"Rio\" films, the road back from the edge of extinction has been a long, winding and bumpy one.SCIENTISTS SAY ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS AS ESSENTIAL AS EVER AFTER 50 YEARS OF SUCCESSThreats that had devastated the Spix’s macaws still loom, and the birds now face another menace: climate change. The species’ original territory overlaps what has recently been officially designated Brazil’s first arid climate region.The drier conditions worry Cromwell Purchase because of their potential impact on habitat for the few surviving Spix’s macaws.\"A dry area only gets rain for a very short period of the year. A drought in that period might go an entire year before you’re going to get your next rain,\" said Purchase, a tall and slim 46-year-old. \"The animals are adapted to harsh environments, but they are on the edge. Any small increment of change will decimate populations.\"In November, two federal research institutes released a study of rainfall water loss in plants and soil between 1960 and 2020. It showed that northern Bahia state, including Curaca, where the Spix’s macaws are trying to survive, is now consistent with a desert area. It also identified the expansion of semi-arid climate in the Northeast, where nearly 55 million people live.LESSER-KNOWN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE US THREATENED BY FUNDING DISPARITIES\"If the planet is warmer, there will be much greater evaporation. So, the water leaves the environment and generates aridity,\" the director of Brazil’s anti-desertification efforts, Alexandre Pires, told The Associated Press.Since 2005, semi-arid area in Brazil has expanded by 116,000 square miles and is now roughly the size of three Californias. The government is set to announce measures to avoid desertification by promoting better management of soil and other natural resources in the region.In the face of the changing climate and numerous challenges, at every turn the Purchases have dedicated the better part of their adult lives to breeding Spix\\'s macaws and reintroducing them into nature. The journey first took the biologists to work with a private collection on an oasis in Qatar. When the birds were sold to a nonprofit organization, the couple moved with them to Germany.Over the past four years, their efforts have been centered in the rural area of Curaca, a nondescript town of 34,000 people.Under an agreement between the Brazilian government and the German nonprofit Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, 52 Spix’s macaws were sent in 2020 to Brazil on two charter flights. Federal police escorted them to breeding and reintroduction facilities accessible by a 1-hour drive on a rough dirt road, where the Purchases live and work for the nonprofit.The following year, 20 Spix’s macaws were released in the wild, along with 15 wild-sourced Blue-Winged macaws, whose purpose was to \"teach\" them how to fly, avoid risks and forage. Last year, two Spix’s macaw chicks were born in freedom — the first ones in decades— but they didn\\'t survive.All released birds were equipped with radio collars designed to resist macaws’ strong bills. Each collar has an antenna. The Purchases and their assistant check the birds\\' locations three times a day.Half of the Spix’s macaws have died, mostly from predation, or disappeared. Now, the remaining ones live within 3 miles of the facilities, a compound that includes the couple’s house and a U-shaped flight-and-release cage that\\'s 51 yards long.In March, three more of the light pale blue chicks were born in the wild. Not only did they survive, but one of them also flew for the first time last week, a major breakthrough.\"This event is so important as it shows how comfortable the parents are in their wild environment,\" Candice Purchase said in a text message. \"A remarkable achievement for the birds and an incredible success for the release.\"US GOVERNMENT DECLARES RARE LIZARD ENDANGERED, SPARKING CLASH BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND OIL INDUSTRYTo mitigate the impacts of desertification, the German parrot nonprofit partnered with a private company, Blue Sky Caatinga, to promote reforestation of 59,300 acres in the territory of Spix’s macaw. This initiative involves engaging small farmers who heavily depend on goat raising.Unlike depictions in the animated films \"Rio\" and \"Rio 2,\" which brought attention to the Spix’s macaw extinction threat, the parrot’s natural habitat is far from Brazil’s most famous city, Rio de Janeiro, and the Amazon rainforest. It lives among the sparse, thorny, low caatinga vegetation that often loses greenery during dry periods. And the bird uses the Caraibeira, a towering evergreen tree that grows near small intermittent creeks, for nesting and food. During breeding season, the trees allow the pairs to conserve energy and avoid flying long distances to feed.When the macaws first arrived from Germany, they were offered various foods from the wild. \"We found that it took a while for the birds to recognize them as food,\" Purchase said. \"But the Caraibeira tree produces a seed pod, almost like helicopter seeds. The Spix’s had never seen anything like it before. We put those in the cages and some picked them up and immediately knew how to open them and eat the kernel inside, which was totally remarkable and took us by surprise.\"The project also faces challenges outside the natural world. On May 15, the federal government informed the nonprofit that it would terminate the agreement, which expires on June 5. In a statement to the AP, Brazil\\'s federal environmental agency said it discovered that, in 2023, the nonprofit transferred Spix’s macaws from its center in Germany to other countries without its consent. The agreement will not be renewed until the situation is clarified, but the government said the nonprofit can continue its reintroduction work. The project\\'s funding comes from international donors.The strained relations have put a pause on plans to release 20 parrots per year over 20 years. \"No release in 2023 and now looking like a 2024 release is unlikely. It would be a shame for the project to fail because of government politics,\" Purchase said.There are approximately 360 Spix’s macaws in captivity worldwide, with 46 in Curaca.Despite the hurdles, many residents of Curaca, even if they never have never seen a Spix\\'s macaw, expect them to soon return to flying over the region and not just be seen in countless paintings that made the parrot part of the city\\'s identity.\"The project is already a success. They are free,\" said Maria de Lourdes Oliveira, whose family leased part of their land for reforestation. \"The most difficult thing was to arrive in Brazil. I cried when I saw them going to freedom and flapping their wings.\"'}\n",

But only recently have they been able to kill the trees. Scientists say they recently discovered about 40 sequoia trees that have died from beetle infestations, mostly within the national parks.\"We’re documenting some trees that are actually dying from kind of a combination of drought and fire that have weakened them to a point where they’re not able to defend themselves from the beetle attack,\" Ambrose said.The beetles attack the trees from the canopy, boring into branches and working their way down the trunk. If left unchecked, the tiny beetles can kill a tree within six months.That’s why park officials allowed Ambrose and his colleagues to climb General Sherman. They conducted the tree health inspection as journalists and visitors watched them pull themselves up ropes dangling from the canopy. They examined the branches and trunk, looking for the tiny holes that indicate beetle activity.But it’s not possible to climb every sequoia tree to directly inspect the canopy in person. That’s why they’re also testing whether drones equipped with sensors and aided by satellite imagery can be used to monitor and detect beetle infestations on a larger scale within the forests.Tuesday’s health inspection of General Sherman was organized by the Giant Sequoia Lands Coalition, a group of government agencies, Native tribes and environmental groups. They hope to establish a health monitoring program for the towering trees.If they discover beetle infestations, officials say, they could try to combat the attacks by spraying water, removing branches or using chemical treatments.Bark beetles have ravaged pine and fir forests throughout the Western United States in recent years, but they previously didn’t pose a threat to giant sequoias, which can live 3,000 years.\"They have really withstood insect attacks for a lot of years. So why now? Why are we seeing this change?\" said Clay Jordan, superintendent for Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. \"There’s a lot that we need to learn in order to ensure good stewardship of these trees for a long time.\"'}\n",

Then research suggested that some could control their body temperature, but when and how that shift came about remained a mystery.Now, a new study estimates that the first warm-blooded dinosaurs may have roamed the Earth about 180 million years ago, about halfway through the creatures’ time on the planet.Warm-blooded creatures — including birds, who are descended from dinosaurs, and humans — keep their body temperature constant whether the world around them runs cold or hot. Cold-blooded animals, including reptiles like snakes and lizards, depend on outside sources to control their temperature: For example, basking in the sun to warm up.NEW MEXICO STUDY SHOWS NEWLY DISCOVERED DINOSAUR SUBSPECIES PREDATES TYRANNOSAURUS REXKnowing when dinosaurs evolved their stable internal thermometer could help scientists answer other questions about how they lived, including how active and social they were.To estimate the origin of the first warm-blooded dinosaurs, researchers analyzed over 1,000 fossils, climate models and dinosaurs’ family trees. They found that two major groups of dinosaurs — which include Tyrannosaurus rex, velociraptors and relatives of triceratops — migrated to chillier areas during the Early Jurassic period, indicating they may have developed the ability to stay warm. A third crop of dinosaurs, which includes brontosaurs, stuck to warmer areas.\"If something is capable of living in the Arctic, or very cold regions, it must have some way of heating up,\" said Alfio Allesandro Chiarenza, a study author and a postdoctoral fellow at University College London.The research was published Wednesday in the journal Current Biology.Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral fellow at the Field Museum in Chicago, said a dinosaur’s location is not the only way to determine whether it is warm-blooded. Research by Wiemann, who was not involved with the latest study, suggests that warm-blooded dinosaurs may have evolved closer to the beginning of their time on Earth, around 250 million years ago.She said compiling clues from multiple aspects of dinosaurs’ lives — including their body temperatures and diets — may help scientists paint a clearer picture of when they evolved to be warm-blooded.'}\n",

They\\'re insects, so they have to shed their skin to get to the next stage, and they will go through their final molt where they pull out of their immature skin, and they will be in their adult skin, which will have wings,\" Benson said.\\xa0\"They’ll molt, expand their wings, harden up and when they\\'re ready they’ll fly up into the trees.\"He said that eventually the cicadas will mate in a noisy fashion and then the females will deposit their eggs onto tree branches. They will hatch and fall into the ground where they will stay for the next 13 or 17 years before the process repeats.\\xa0So many cicadas will make noise at once in some places that sound levels might reach upward of 90 to 120 decibels, equivalent to a gas-powered lawnmower or motorcycle, the U.S. Forest Service says.\\xa0Meanwhile, the mating cicadas will die off and homeowners will be left hoping that the dead carcasses do not land in their gardens as they can smell badly if they die in large numbers together.Females\\xa0laying their eggs on small tree branches can harm young trees and the EPA advises covering maturing saplings in mesh or netting to keep the insects out.Experts also advise homeowners to cover pools, patio furniture or similar items from cicada or their droppings when they are active.Brood XIII cicadas appear on a 17-year cycle, and are restricted mostly to northern Illinois, eastern Iowa, southern Wisconsin and a few counties in extreme northwestern Indiana, according to entomologist Floyd Shockley of the Smithsonian Institution\\'s National Museum of Natural History in Washington.\\xa0Brood XIX emerges on a slightly shorter 13-year cycle, and are widely distributed from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia - a total of 15 states, according to Shockley.

The clicks are also used as a form of echolocation to help them track their prey.Scientists have been trying for decades to understand what those clicks might mean, with only minimal progress. While they still don\\'t know, they now think there are sets of clicks they believe make up a \"phonetic alphabet\" that the whales can use to build the very rough equivalent of what people think of as words and phrases.REAL LIFE DR. DOLITTLE? SCIENTISTS ON VERGE OF CRACKING CODE FOR TALKING TO ANIMALS\"We\\'re now starting to find the first building blocks of whale language,\" said David Gruber, founder and president of the Cetacean Translation Initiative or CETI, an effort devoted to translating the communication of sperm whales.In a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, researchers analyzed more than 8,700 snippets of sperm whale clicks, known as codas. They say they have found four basic components they think make up this phonetic alphabet.Pratyusha Sharma, the paper\\'s lead researcher, said this alphabet could then be used by the whales in an unlimited number of combinations.\"It doesn’t appear that they have a fixed set of codas,\" said Sharma, an artificial intelligence and computer science expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"That gives the whales access to a much larger communication system,\" she said, explaining it was as if the whales had a very large dictionary.Sperm whales have the biggest brains of any animal on the planet at up to 20 pounds, as much as six times the size of an average human brain. Thy live in matriarchal groups of about 10 and sometimes meet up with hundreds or thousands of other whales. Sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet long and dive to nearly 3,280 feet to hunt for squid. They sleep vertically, in groups.Gruber, a biology professor at the City University of New York, said sperm whales seem to have sophisticated social ties and deciphering their communication systems could reveal parallels with human language and society.To get enough examples of the sperm whale clicks in Dominica, where there is a resident population of about 200 whales, scientists created a giant underwater recording studio with microphones at different depths. Tags on the whales also record what position they are in when clicking — for example diving, sleeping, breathing at the surface — and if there are any other whales nearby they might be communicating with.Jeremy Goldbogen, an associate professor of oceans at Stanford University, called the new research \"extraordinary,\" saying it had \"vast implications for how we understand ocean giants.\"Goldbogen, who was not involved in the study, said that if we were one day able to understand what sperm whales were saying, that knowledge should be used for conservation purposes, like minimizing their risk of being hit by ships or reducing ocean noise levels.Sperm whales are classified as \" vulnerable \" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The whales were hunted for centuries for the oil contained in their giant heads and the species is still recovering.Diana Reiss, a marine mammal behavior and communication expert at the City University of New York, said that scientists understand certain aspects of marine animals\\' communication reasonably well, including the whistles used by dolphins and the songs sung by humpback whales.But when it comes to sperm whales, even that basic knowledge is lacking.\"What\\'s new in this study is that they are trying to look at the basis for the whales\\' communication system ... not just particular calls they\\'re making,\" she said.Reiss, who was not involved in the new research, said she hoped we would one day be able to match the whales’ clicks to behavior.\"We will never understand what the clicks mean to another whale, but we may be able to understand what the clicks mean enough to predict their behavior,\" she said. \"That alone would be an amazing achievement,\" she said.CETI founder Gruber said millions and possibly billions of whale codas would be needed to collect enough data to try to work out what the whales are saying, but he expects AI to help speed the analysis. He said other sperm whale populations — the whales are found in deep oceans from the Arctic to the Antarctic — likely communicate in slightly different ways.'}\n",

Corals are central to marine ecosystems, and while these projects won’t stem the tide of damage from human-caused climate change, they are seen as part of broader solutions.The World Coral Conservatory hopes to create a bank of corals in aquariums across Europe that could be used to repopulate wild coral reefs if they succumb to the stress of climate change or pollution.Along with two zoos in France and the originator of the project — the Monaco Scientific Center — the zoo in the east of the Netherlands took in more than a dozen coral fragments from off the coast of Seychelles in east Africa.The Dutch zoo has been propagating the corals since 2022, allowing them to grow in a highly regulated environment before they were large enough to join the rest of the reef.CORAL REEFS AROUND THE WORLD ARE EXPERIENCING MASS BLEACHING IN WARMING OCEANS, SCIENTISTS SAY\"We test it behind the scenes … what works for these corals. In that way, we know where to place them and how to keep them,\" zookeeper Pascal Kik said.Each diver held up a coral — one that resembled a large mushroom, the other a decorative cookie — to be photographed by reporters before placing them on a ledge near the center of the 8-million-liter (2.1-million-gallon) tank.Few of the other corals at the zoo come from the wild. They are either shared by other zoos or turned over by Dutch customs officers after being confiscated. Coral poaching is a major threat to coral reefs in parts of Asia.That would make it difficult to return the corals to the wild. But the team knows exactly where their 14 corals came from, making it more likely they could be successfully reintroduced if needed.Corals area keystone marine species, according to Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society. Eakin, retired coral monitoring chief at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that around 25% of marine animals spend some part of their lives dependent on coral reefs.That makes projects such as the one in Arnhem all the more important to pursue, he said.\"We are in a situation where we really need to be taking any possible action we can,\" Eakin told AP.Earlier in April, scientists from the NOAA and International Coral Reef Initiative said that coral reefs around the world are experiencing global bleaching for the fourth time.Bleaching occurs when coral under stress expels the algae that gives them their vibrant colors. The algae is also a coral’s food source, and if the bleaching lasts for too long or is too severe, the coral could die.In the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, bleaching affected 90% of the coral assessed in 2022. The Florida Coral Reef, the third-largest, experienced significant bleaching last year.Terry Hughes of Australia’s James Cook University, an expert on the Great Barrier Reef, argues that the world needs faster, bolder efforts to stop the damage from climate change, instead of small-scale restoration projects like this one.\"You can’t replace a magnificent ecosystem with an aquarium,\" he said.Others say every little bit helps.\"Coral reefs would be one of the first systems to totally collapse due to climate change,’’ said Ronald Osinga, a marine biologist who specializes in corals at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.\"It’s sad that it has to be like this,\" said Osinga, who is not involved in the Dutch zoo initiative. But projects like this are a \"good backup plan.\"'}\n",

Now, it has colorful competition.There’s a growing buzz around pink noise, brown noise, green noise — a rainbow of soothing sounds — and their theoretical effects on sleep, concentration and relaxation response.The science is new with only a few small studies behind it, but that hasn’t stopped thousands of people from listening to hours of these noises on YouTube and on meditation apps that provide a palette of color noises with paid subscriptions.IMPROVING MEMORY MAY BE AS EASY AS POPPING A MULTIVITAMIN, STUDY FINDS: ‘PREVENTS VASCULAR DEMENTIA\\'To understand pink noise, start with white, the most familiar of the color noises.White noise is similar to static on a radio or TV. Sound engineers define it as having equal volume across all the frequencies audible to the human ear. It gets its name from white light, which contains all the visible color wavelengths.But the high frequencies of white noise can sound harsh. Pink noise turns down the volume on those higher frequencies, so it sounds lower in pitch and more like the natural sound of rain or the ocean.Brown noise sounds even lower in pitch, giving it a pleasing, soothing rumble.Pink and brown, like white, have standard definitions to audio experts. Other color noises are more recent creations with very flexible definitions.White noise and pink noise may provide small benefits for people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, according to a recent review of limited ADHD studies. In theory, it wakes up the brain, said ADHD researcher and co-author Joel Nigg of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.\"The noise provides stimulation to the brain without providing information, and so it doesn’t distract,\" Nigg said.White noise has been used to treat ringing or buzzing in the ear, called tinnitus.Scientists at Northwestern University are studying how short pulses of pink noise can enhance the slow brain waves of deep sleep. In small studies, these pink-noise pulses have shown promise in improving memory and the relaxation response.Pink noise has a frequency profile \"very similar to the distribution of brain wave frequencies we see in slow-wave sleep because these are large, slow waves,\" said Dr. Roneil Malkani, assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.If Northwestern’s research pans out, it could lead to a medical device to improve sleep or memory through personalized pulses of pink noise. But many scientific questions remain unanswered, Malkani said. \"There’s still a lot of work we have to do.\"If color noises feel calming and help you drown out distractions, it makes sense to use them. Keep them at a quiet level, of course, to prevent hearing loss and take \"plenty of breaks for the ears to rest,\" Nigg said.'}\n",

The orangutan then used his fingers to apply the plant juices to an injury on the right cheek. Afterward, he pressed the chewed plant to cover the open wound like a makeshift bandage, according to a new study in Scientific Reports.Previous research has documented several species of great apes foraging for medicines in forests to heal themselves, but scientists hadn\\'t yet seen an animal treat itself in this way.ZOO JOY: HEARTS MELT WHEN ORANGUTAN \\'ASKS\\' TO SEE BABY THROUGH ENCLOSURE, THEN \\'KISSES\\' GLASS\"This is the first time that we have observed a wild animal applying a quite potent medicinal plant directly to a wound,\" said co-author Isabelle Laumer, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany.The orangutan\\'s intriguing behavior was recorded in 2022 by Ulil Azhari, a co-author and field researcher at the Suaq Project in Medan, Indonesia. Photographs show the animal’s wound closed within a month without any problems.Scientists have been observing orangutans in Indonesia’s Gunung Leuser National Park since 1994, but they hadn’t previously seen this behavior.\"It’s a single observation,\" said Emory University biologist Jacobus de Roode, who was not involved in the study. \"But often we learn about new behaviors by starting with a single observation.\"\"Very likely it’s self-medication,\" said de Roode, adding that the orangutan applied the plant only to the wound and no other body part.MISSOURI ZOO WELCOMES NEWBORN BORNEAN ORANGUTAN JUST BEFORE MOTHER\\'S DAYIt’s possible Rakus learned the technique from other orangutans living outside the park and away from scientists\\' daily scrutiny, said co-author Caroline Schuppli at Max Planck.Rakus was born and lived as a juvenile outside the study area. Researchers believe the orangutan got hurt in a fight with another animal. It\\'s not known whether Rakus earlier treated other injuries.Scientists have previously recorded other primates using plants to treat themselves.Bornean orangutans rubbed themselves with juices from a medicinal plant, possibly to reduce body pains or chase away parasites.Chimpanzees in multiple locations have been observed chewing on the shoots of bitter-tasting plants to soothe their stomachs. Gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos swallow certain rough leaves whole to get rid of stomach parasites.\"If this behavior exists in some of our closest living relatives, what could that tell us about how medicine first evolved?\" said Tara Stoinski, president and chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, who had no role in the study.'}\n",

reflected on the longevity-boosting benefits of the Mediterranean diet in a conversation with Fox News Digital.\"One big reason that the Mediterranean diet can improve overall health and reduce mortality risk is the benefit it has on visceral fat, or belly fat,\" said Palinksi-Wade, who was not involved in the research.\"High levels of fat in the midsection have been found to worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of disease from type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease,\" she added.By making dietary changes to reduce visceral fat, which include the eating principles of the Mediterranean diet, it is possible to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce disease risk, according to Palinski-Wade.This diet is also rich in antioxidants and phytonutrients, she said, which have been shown to reduce inflammation in the body.\\xa0This can help to reduce the risk of future disease, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.MEDITERRANEAN, MIND DIETS SHOWN TO REDUCE

non-Hispanic White individuals, which may limit the generalizability of the findings,\" they wrote.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERBecause the women’s dietary intake was self-reported

And they hope their discovery leads to a new diagnosis that can provide answers to families.Those with the condition have a constellation of issues, which also include short stature, small heads, seizures and low muscle mass, said the researchers, who published their findings in the journal Nature Medicine on Friday.\"We were struck by how common this disorder is\" when compared with other rare diseases linked to a single gene, said Ernest Turro of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, senior author of the study.CHILDREN WITH INHERITED DEAFNESS HEAR FOR FIRST TIME THROUGH EXPERIMENTAL GENE THERAPYSyndromes like these can go unnoticed because the traits are sometimes so subtle doctors can’t recognize them by just looking at patients, said Dr. Charles Billington, a pediatric geneticist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the study.\"So certainly this wasn’t something that we necessarily had a name for,\" he said. \"We’re learning more about these syndromes that we recognize only once we are seeing the cause.\"Researchers said the mutations occurred in a small \"non-coding\" gene, meaning it doesn’t provide instructions for making proteins. Until now, all but nine of the nearly 1,500 genes known to be linked to intellectual disability in general are protein-coding genes. Most large genetic studies so far have used a sequencing technology that typically leaves out genes that don\\'t code for proteins.This study used more comprehensive \"whole-genome\" sequencing data from 77,539 people enrolled in the British 100,000 Genomes Project, including 5,529 with an intellectual disability. The rare mutations researchers found in the gene, called RNU4-2, were strongly associated with the potential to develop intellectual disability.The finding \"opens the door to diagnoses\" for thousands of families, said study author Andrew Mumford, research director of the South West England NHS Genomic Medicine Service.More research is needed, Mumford said. How the mutation causes the disorder remains unclear and there is no treatment. But Billington said labs should be able to offer testing for this condition relatively quickly. And researchers said families should be able to find and support each other – and know they’re not alone.\"That can be incredibly comforting,\" Mumford said.'}\n",

DENTAL PROFESSIONALS SHARE RISKS AND REMEDIESAlthough Mack could not confirm whether there is a difference in salivary pH between men and women, he \"won\\'t deny\" the potential for some type of \"relative correlation of factors that affect women more than men.\"He said, \"The quality of saliva is going to vary from individual to individual, and it\\'s going to depend on how many minerals — like calcium, phosphate and fluorohydroxyapatite — are in that saliva. We also have to consider the flow rate of the saliva, or how much saliva is present, and any kind of conditions that are going to affect men and women differently.\"In Phillips\\' TikTok video, she recommends taking a daily dose of xylitol, a natural sugar alcohol, to counteract salivary acidity.\"When you put xylitol, even a tiny 1-gram amount, on the tip of your tongue, you will stimulate a flow of saliva into your mouth,\" she said.This extra saliva has \"all the minerals you need,\" Phillips said, as well as reparative cells for gum health.The expert recommended ingesting xylitol, such as a Zellie’s dental mint, at the end of a meal and then abstaining from eating or drinking for an hour afterward.THESE ARE THE WORST DENTAL MISTAKES YOU CAN MAKE FOR YOUR TEETHMack agreed that xylitol is an \"incredible tool,\" as it doesn’t have any carbs that get \"metabolized by acid-loving bacteria. Xylitol promotes pH buffering when the salivary flow is reduced,\" he said.\\xa0Mack recommended other products, such as StellaLife kits and xylitol candy and lozenges.Patients can also take certain medications to increase salivary flow, he added.In addition to taking xylitol, it is crucial to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and eat nutrient-rich foods, Nischwitz recommended.\"It is true that having a xylitol mint will lead to more saliva flow in the short term and is definitely recommended, but it won’t solve it completely if the lifestyle doesn’t support the oral microbiome,\" he told Fox News Digital.\"Processed foods are usually low in key minerals or can even deplete the body\\'s minerals due to chelating agents like phytic acid.\"Key micronutrients that help to remineralize teeth include vitamin D3, vitamin K2, magnesium, phosphorus, boron and essential amino acids, according to Nischwitz.Using more natural toothpaste and ditching the super-acidic, chemical mouthwashes are other factors to consider, he recommended.\\xa0\"Instead of chemical mouthwashes, which harm your oral microbiome and make the saliva super acidic, try coconut oil pulling instead,\" Nischwitz advised.\\xa0CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERIn a statement sent to Fox News Digital, Phillips reiterated that it is \"paramount\" for women to be included in research studies.\"Their hormonal fluctuations, menstrual cycles and biological nuances demand far greater attention and accommodation than they currently receive,\" she wrote. \"I\\'m thrilled that we\\'re finally delving into the crucial aspects of women\\'s oral health as a society.\"The condition of a mother’s oral health during pregnancy has a \"direct impact\" on her baby’s oral health, which is a \"vital yet often neglected conversation,\" Phillips said.\"It’s astounding that the microbiome that develops before the age of 4 contributes to up to 40% of the mouth bacteria that we have as adults,\" she said.\\xa0\"If we can help mothers create a healthy mouth for themselves, we can start to truly affect the global epidemic of dental disease that\\'s upon us.\"More than half of Americans suffer from dental issues that are most likely preventable, according to Phillips.\"This shift requires us to truly evaluate the current dental industry, start asking the right questions and expand the research on gender differences and effective oral care strategies,\" she said.For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health.\\xa0'}\n",

            "{'title': 'How to easily start an outdoor exercise routine', 'description': 'For those who do not enjoy working out in a gym, exercising outdoors can make a great alternative. Plus, you get the added health benefits of spending time in nature.', 'content': 'Between the sweat smell, fluorescent lights and omnipresent television screens, April Herring has never connected with going to the gym.Instead, she runs, bikes, hikes, plays tennis, pickleball and football — anything to get her exercise outside as often as possible.\"Fresh air, sunshine, the variety of the trees as the seasons change,\" said Herring, an administrator at Carroll Community College in North Maryland. \"There’s something about the energetic healing quality of nature.\"GET THIS FITNESS GEAR THAT’S ACTUALLY COMFORTABLE TO WORKOUT INThe health benefits of spending time in nature have long been established, and exercise in general, of course, improves physical and mental well-being.Combine the two and you double down on what adults need to stay healthy, said Debbie Rhea, professor in kinesiology at Texas Christian University.\"We’ve got to get outside. We’ve got to be active,\" Rhea said. \"If we’re going to live long lives, this is what it’s about.\"Getting started on an outdoor routine, however, might not be as easy as signing up for another gym membership. Here’s how to get going.If you haven’t been active for a while, think back to the activities you enjoyed years ago, suggested Connie Sciolino, founder of the Alpine Training Center in Boulder, Colorado, a gym that trains athletes for outdoor mountain sports.People who like occasionally hiking or biking should start building an aerobic base by taking progressively longer walks or rides. Once you’re comfortably in the 35- to 45-minute range, start adding some intensity to build strength, she said.\"If jogging is their main activity, I would send them to the bleachers or do some up-down on stairs, either in sprint format or put a pack on their back,\" she said.Rhea cautioned against jumping back into a sport you used to play without preparing your body for the proper movement.\"Let’s say they’re in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and they haven’t sprinted and now they try to run around those bases,\" she said. \"They’re probably going to hurt an Achilles or a hamstring or something by doing something too fast.\"A side benefit of exercising outside is that there’s no need to buy expensive equipment, trainers say.After warming up with your preferred aerobic activity, add strength training by using your body weight and what is available in the built environment. That could be finding a picnic table or low wall and placing your hands shoulder-width apart to do leaning pushups. Then turn around, put your hands on the same surface and lower your body for dips that work your triceps.For working your legs, add squats with your feet shoulder-width apart, looking straight ahead with your back straight. Add lunges by taking giant steps and bending down into the space between your feet. For the core, find a patch of grass to do sit-ups.Start with eight to 10 repetitions, or no more than you are comfortable with, and add sets with short breaks in between as you get stronger.For a more complete workout, find a park or trail with outdoor exercise equipment, which is installed in one-third of park agencies, according to the National Recreation and Park Association. The equipment can range from basic pull-up bars to gym-style bench presses and rowing machines.And many cities, including Chicago, San Antonio and Atlanta, offer free group classes outdoors.When it inevitably rains or the weather turns colder, it helps to keep in mind an old axiom: There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.\"If we have the clothing for whatever the temperatures are that we may be in, then we’re more likely to go outside to be active when we need to,\" Rhea said.She suggested investing in a jacket that breathes and a light hat with a brim you can use on sunny or rainy days.Trainer Katie Higginbotham recommended having a contingency plan for inclement weather. Pick an area with surfaces that won’t get slippery when wet or somewhere with some tree shelter so as not to be bombarded by rain.On those days, having a regular exercise buddy really helps, said Higginbotham, who oversees quality control for TrainFitness, a U.K.-based private training provider.\"If you know someone is there waiting for you, it’s difficult to say no at the last minute,\" she said.Finally, it helps to set a goal, whether that is training for a 5K charity walk or a triathlon. If you’re working toward something, it keeps you motivated to keep going, Sciolino said.\"When you have that day marked on your calendar, you have to perform these things or die out there,\" she said.'}\n",

These synthetic substances might be more potent and addictive than traditional nicotine.', 'content': 'Nicotine alternatives used in vapes being launched in the U.S. and abroad, such as 6-methyl nicotine, may be more potent and addictive than nicotine itself, though the scientific data remains incomplete, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and independent researchers.The synthetic substances - which have a chemical structure similar to that of nicotine - are not subject to U.S. tobacco and vaping regulations that are designed to control traditional nicotine, a highly addictive drug.That means manufacturers can sell vapes containing synthetic nicotine analogues such as 6-methyl nicotine in the United States without seeking authorization from the FDA - a process that can be costly, time-consuming and is often unsuccessful.YOUNG VAPER WHO REQUIRED DOUBLE LUNG TRANSPLANT SHARES WARNINGS AS E-CIGARETTE SALES RISEBig tobacco firms like Altria Group and British American Tobacco have already lost substantial U.S. sales to an influx of disposable vapes containing traditional nicotine that are being illegally sold without FDA authorization.Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, highlighted the emerging use of 6-methyl nicotine in vapes and other smoking alternatives in a May 9 letter to the FDA, according to a copy of the correspondence posted on its website.It urged the agency to evaluate the compounds and establish what authority it had over them, warning they posed a \"new threat\" to regulation of the sector.\"The introduction and growth of chemicals intended to imitate the effects of nicotine, if left unchecked, could present unknown risks to U.S. consumers and undermine FDA’s authority,\" the letter said.SMOKING CIGARETTES CAN DESTROY LUNGS, BUT SHOCKING NEW STUDY REVEALS WHY VAPING CAN HARM THE HEARTIt cited SPREE BAR, a vape launched in October by Charlie\\'s Holdings Inc that uses 6-methyl nicotine.The FDA does not comment on its correspondence with individual firms.In response to Reuters\\' questions about 6-methyl nicotine and other nicotine alternatives, the FDA said in a statement: \"Although more research is needed, some emerging data show these nicotine analogs may be more potent than nicotine – which is already highly addictive, can alter adolescent brain development and have long-term effects on youth\\'s attention, learning and memory.\"Traditional nicotine found in many vapes and pouches is extracted from tobacco leaves. 6-methyl nicotine, in contrast, is made entirely in the lab using chemicals.The FDA said it was considering the use of such synthetic compounds from an \"agency-wide perspective\" and would use all of its resources to protect youth from products that may harm their health. As well as tobacco products, the FDA also regulates drugs, foods, cosmetics and more to ensure safety and efficacy.\"The FDA is a data-driven agency, and we\\'re in the process of reviewing the available data to inform potential actions in this space,\" it said in response to Reuters\\' questions.Three academic researchers told the news agency that current studies of 6-methyl nicotine are too limited to draw definite conclusions on the health impact or to what degree it is addictive.Imad Damaj, a professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University, said his research showed 6-methyl nicotine may be more potent than nicotine, but more extensive tests were needed to say what impact it has on humans.The limitations of existing research included that some papers were industry funded, while others focused on the short-term impact on animals or cells and were insufficient to understand 6-methyl nicotine\\'s effects on human bodies, the researchers said.Charlie\\'s Holdings calls the 6-methyl nicotine solution used in SPREE BAR Metatine. SPREE BAR\\'s website says Metatine \"may have a toxicity profile similar to nicotine\".SPREE BAR promises users 6,000 puffs from each device and offers fruity flavors including \"blue razz ice\" and \"creamy melon\", according to its website.The FDA has yet to approve any flavored vape using traditional nicotine for sale in the United States, saying companies have not been able to show that the health benefits they offer to smokers outweigh the known risks to young people, who may be more attracted by the flavors.Charlie\\'s Holdings co-founder Ryan Stump told Reuters that the company only targets adults, adding that flavors played an important role in its mission to help smokers quit cigarettes.Stump said Charlie\\'s Holdings respects and abides by laws in every market where it operates. He acknowledged that more research is needed on 6-methyl nicotine, adding that the company dilutes it in its products.US SCHOOLS INVEST MILLIONS IN SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY TO COMBAT TEEN VAPING EPIDEMICAnes Saleh sells SPREE BAR in his vape shop in Denver, Colorado, called Sultan Smoke. He said he has some customers who only buy Spree Bar instead of a nicotine vape and he hasn\\'t had any negative feedback on the product.\"The only... protest I would hear about people not wanting to try this is that they don\\'t know what Metatine is or does,\" he said.Stump said that Charlie\\'s Holdings is working on new varieties of SPREE BAR and new products using 6-methyl nicotine. It will launch SPREE BAR internationally this year. He declined to say where.The company buys the 6-methyl nicotine solution used in SPREE BAR from another U.S. firm, Novel Compounds, according to Novel Compounds\\' founder Samuel Benaim.Novel Compounds imports 6-methyl nicotine from overseas and alters it to make it easier for manufacturers like Charlie\\'s Holdings to use in their products. It sells this solution under the trade name imotine.Tests commissioned by Novel Compounds have found 6-methyl nicotine to be no more harmful than nicotine, Benaim said. But he also said that more research was needed into the chemical.Benaim added that Novel Compounds had received legal advice that its product is not classified as a tobacco product or drug in the United States. The company is committed to legal compliance, he said.Sven Jordt, a professor at Duke University, who has authored papers on products like SPREE BAR, said 6-methyl nicotine could me more addictive and toxic than its traditional cousin.\"Do we want to have such a chemical as a recreational product, available to anyone?,\" he asked. \"That\\'s really questionable.\"Neither Jordt nor Damaj - the professor at Virginia Commonwealth University - have received funding from tobacco or vape makers.As well as the United States, Novel Compounds also sells its 6-methyl nicotine solution around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, India and Japan.Another company, Aroma King, sells 6-methyl nicotine in the United Kingdom in pouches, which users insert under the lip to get a buzz. The pouches are sold in cans emblazoned with graphics of gorillas in suits and sunglasses.It said in a February blog post that its 6-methyl nicotine products were \"less toxic\", \"less harmful\", and \"less addictive\" than regular nicotine products.In a statement to Reuters, Aroma King cited existing research, its own toxicology and other tests and its supplier, which classifies 6-methyl nicotine as less toxic under the European Union\\'s Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP) Regulation.Aroma King said 6-methyl nicotine was self-classified by its supplier. It declined to say who supplies it with the chemical.Four Chinese companies hold patents in China related to the production of 6-methyl nicotine, including Zinwi Biotech, a company that makes the liquid used in vapes.Zinwi Biotech confirmed it is researching 6-methyl nicotine but did not answer further questions, including on whether it has sold any 6-methyl nicotine so far. Reuters was unable to find contact details for the other firms.'}\n",

In this installment of \"Ask a Doctor,\" two health experts advise when to seek medical attention for swelling or edema.', 'content': 'If you notice your hands are swelling, it could be both uncomfortable and unsettling, but in most instances the cause could be situational — caused by factors such as temperature, exercise, diet, medications you’re taking or certain health conditions.\\xa0\\xa0You may notice your rings aren’t fitting correctly, among other things.To find out more about the condition, Fox News Digital asked two doctors what causes hand swelling and what can be done to treat it.\\xa0ASK A DOCTOR: ‘WHY AM I HEARING MY HEARTBEAT IN MY EARS?’Here’s what you need to know.Most commonly, hand swelling is due to fluid buildup in the soft tissue.\\xa0\"Soft tissue swelling, or edema, is not always a cause for concern, and can occur with weather changes or fluid shifts in the body,\" said Amy Kehl, M.D., RhMSUS, a board-certified rheumatologist with Saint John\\'s Physician Partners in Santa Monica, California.Most patients observe some degree of soft tissue swelling or edema with hot weather and with exercise, according to Kehl.Fluid shifts can also occur with too much salt intake, she noted, which can lead to increased hand or foot swelling, she said.\\xa0\\xa0\"Additionally, certain medications, such as blood pressure medications like amlodipine; steroids such as Prednisone or Medrol; or hormone treatments, can contribute to soft tissue swelling in the hands or feet,\" Kehl added.\\xa0If a person notices an increase in hand or foot swelling that is not reversible or intermittent — or if the hand swelling is also accompanied by leg swelling with marked elevations in blood pressure or shortness of breath — medical attention should be sought, Kehl said.\\xa0ASK A DOCTOR: ‘IS IT DANGEROUS TO SWALLOW GUM?’A person \"should ensure they have had proper medical evaluation to assess both kidney and cardiac function, as hand or foot swelling can be an indicator of kidney dysfunction, protein loss in the urine, or cardiac dysfunction,\" she cautioned.\\xa0\"Your doctor may order tests to assess your kidney function, urine studies or, in some cases, an echocardiogram.\"\\xa0Diuretics may be needed to remove the excess fluid if it is related to cardiac dysfunction, she said. \\xa0ASK A DOCTOR: ‘IS IT DANGEROUS TO CRACK MY NECK OR BACK?’Another possible cause of fluid build-up is lymphedema, which can occur if the patient has had surgery, such as a lymph node resection for breast cancer treatment, according to Kehl.\"This may be treated with local lymphatic drainage treatments, arm elevation, compression sleeves and exercise,\" the doctor said.Individuals should also be cognizant of other symptoms.\\xa0\"Certainly, if the hand swelling is associated with joint pains, this may indicate an underlying inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis,\" Kehl told Fox News Digital. \"Again, an examination may be warranted to distinguish soft tissue swelling from articular or joint swelling.\"Patients should also be aware if the swelling is asymmetric.\\xa0\"This can be a sign of something more serious, such as a blood clot, and patients should seek medical attention right away if new and asymmetric swelling and pain develops,\" Kehl warned.\\xa0ASK A DOCTOR: \\'HOW CAN I IMPROVE MY POSTURE?\\'If a patient notices hand swelling in association with facial or lip swelling, this warrants immediate medical attention, she said.If the hand swelling is deemed to be due to \"benign causes,\" this is typically reversible, Kehl noted.\"For instance, to reduce hand swelling after exercising, elevating the hands and performing arm circles may be helpful to increase the blood flow to the hands,\" she said.\\xa0Similarly, it may be necessary to review your medication list with your medical provider to identify any pharmaceutical culprits.\\xa0\"Typically, with discontinuation of the offending medication, the swelling should subside,\" Kehl said.ASK A DOCTOR: \\'HOW CAN I PREVENT HIGH CHOLESTEROL?\\'Diet should also be monitored.\\xa0Maintaining the proper balance of salt and water is important, and reducing salt intake and following a low-sodium diet may be advisable for some patients, the expert noted.Lifestyle changes, such as movement, can also be incorporated to help alleviate the swelling.\\xa0\"Stretch both arms up, move your hands and wrists, and make fists several times,\" Beth Oller, M.D., a family physician with Rooks County Health Center in Stockton, Kansas, told Fox News Digital.\\xa0CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERRunning your hands under cool water may help, she said, and taking off jewelry or constricting clothes while exercising can also help prevent swelling due to temperature changes.\\xa0\"Staying well-hydrated can also help keep fluids circulating,\" Oller added.Pregnancy is another common cause of swelling. In that case, Oller said that moving the extremities can help.\\xa0\"If swelling in pregnancy occurs suddenly or is extreme, talk to your physician immediately, as this can be a symptom of elevated blood pressure,\" she also said.\\xa0For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health.'}\n",

They also said the most important aspect of the galaxy was how luminous the galaxy was from such a far distance.The galaxy is estimated to be more than 1,600 light years across, and the light is suspected to be coming from young stars and not emission from a growing supermassive black hole.WITNESS THE MESMERIZING CONJUNCTION OF THE MOON AND VENUS IN SPACEThe starlight also implies the galaxy is several hundreds of millions of times the mass of the Sun, the astronomers claim, leading to more mysteries of how it can make such a bright and massive galaxy in less than 300 million years.The astronomers learned through the data that the color of the galaxy was reddened by dust and was not as blue as it could be in early phases of the galaxy.Wavelengths of light collected by Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) indicated the brightness of the source was above what would be extrapolated from the measurements of other instruments on the telescope, suggesting the presence of ionized gas emission from hydrogen and oxygen.They say oxygen being present at such an early stage suggests multiple generations of massive stars already lived their lives before the telescope was able to observe the galaxy, the astronomers said.\"All of these observations, together, tell us that JADES-GS-z14-0 is not like the types of galaxies that have been predicted by theoretical models and computer simulations to exist in the very early universe,\" the astronomers said in the press release. \"Given the observed brightness of the source, we can forecast how it might grow over cosmic time, and so far, we have not found any suitable analogs from the hundreds of other galaxies we’ve observed at high redshift in our survey.\\xa0\"It is likely that astronomers will find many such luminous galaxies, possibly at even earlier times, over the next decade with Webb,\" the team added. \"We’re thrilled to see the extraordinary diversity of galaxies that existed at Cosmic Dawn!\"The findings are still being studied and have not been through the peer-review process, according to NASA.The Webb Telescope, the successor to the Hubble and the largest telescope ever launched into space, is a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency.\\xa0'}\n",

Previous calculations put the roots of this process more than 130,000 miles below, an international team reported Wednesday.The sun’s intense magnetic energy is the source of solar flares and eruptions of plasma known as coronal mass ejections. When directed toward Earth, they can create stunning auroras but also disrupt power and communications.EARTH IN THE CLEAR AFTER SUN EMITS LARGEST SOLAR FLARE IN NEARLY 10-YEAR CYCLE\"We still don’t understand the sun well enough to make accurate predictions\" of space weather, lead author Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh said in an email.The latest findings published in the journal Nature \"will be an important step toward finally resolving\" this mysterious process known as solar dynamo, added co-author Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University.Galileo was among the first astronomers to turn a telescope skyward and study sunspots, back in the early 1600s. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur near sunspots, dark patches as big as Earth that are located near the most intense portions of the sun’s shifting magnetic field.Vasil and his team developed new models of the interaction between the sun’s magnetic field and the flow of plasma, which varies at different latitudes during an 11-year cycle. They fed their calculations into a NASA supercomputer in Northern California — the same one used in the 2015 movie \"The Martian\" to verify the best flight path to rescue the main character. The results suggested a shallow magnetic field and additional research is needed to confirm this.The modeling was \"highly simplified,\" University of Wisconsin-Madison\\'s Ellen Zweibel, who was not part of the team, said in an accompanying editorial.The results are intriguing and \"sure to inspire future studies,\" Zweibel said.The new knowledge should improve long-term solar forecasts, allowing scientists to better predict the strength of our star\\'s future cycles. The sun is approaching its peak level of activity in the current 11-year cycle, thus the recent flareups.Strong solar flares and outbursts of billions of tons of plasma earlier this month unleashed severe solar storms that produced auroras in unexpected places. Last week, the sun spewed out the biggest solar flare in almost 20 years, but it steered clear of Earth.Better understanding of the sun can ensure \"we are prepared for when the next storm — potentially much more dangerous — hits Earth,\" Lecoanet said.'}\n",

It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Chang’e 5, which did so from the near side in 2020.LAS VEGAS ALIENS 'TRY TO STAVE OFF PESKY HUMANS,' EXPERT SAYS: 'WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?'The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S. — still the leader in space exploration — and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there.The emerging global power aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make it the second nation after the United States to do so. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon again — for the first time in more than 50 years — though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year.U.S. efforts to use private-sector rockets to launch spacecraft have been repeatedly delayed. Last-minute computer trouble nixed the planned launch of Boeing's first astronaut flight Saturday.Earlier Saturday, a Japanese billionaire called off his plan to orbit the moon because of uncertainty over the development of a mega rocket by SpaceX. NASA is planning to use the rocket to send its astronauts to the moon.In China’s current mission, the lander is to use a mechanical arm and a drill to gather up to 4.4 pounds of surface and underground material over about two days.An ascender atop the lander will then take the samples in a metal vacuum container back to another module that is orbiting the moon. The container will be transferred to a reentry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the deserts of China’s Inner Mongolia region about June 25.Missions to the moon’s far side are more difficult because it doesn’t face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications. The terrain is also more rugged, with fewer flat areas to land.The South Pole-Aitken Basin, an impact crater created more than 4 billion years ago, is 8 miles deep and has a diameter of 1,500 miles, according to a report by China's Xinhua News Agency.It is the oldest and largest of such craters on the moon, so may provide the earliest information about it, Xinhua said, adding that the huge impact may have ejected materials from deep below the surface.\"}\n",

About 35 minutes later it separated entirely from the massive Long March-5 rocket — China\\'s largest — that had slung it into space, as technicians monitoring the launch from ground control smiled and applauded.Shortly afterward, launch mission commander Zhang Zuosheng took to a podium at the front of the room and said the launch had gone off exactly as planned and the spacecraft was on its set trajectory. \"I declare this launch mission a complete success,\" Zhang said to further applause.The Philippine Space Agency issued a statement saying expected debris from the rocket launch was \"projected to have fallen within the identified drop zones.\"China in 2021 was forced to defend its handling of a rocket booster that burned up over the Indian Ocean after the administrator of the American space agency and others accused Beijing of acting recklessly by allowing its rocket to fall to Earth seemingly uncontrolled after the mission.Huge numbers of people crowded Hainan\\'s beaches to view the launch, which comes in the middle of China’s five-day May Day holiday. As with previous recent launches, the event was televised live by state broadcaster CCTV.After orbiting the moon to reduce speed, the lander will separate from the spacecraft and within 48 hours of setting down it will begin drilling into the lunar surface and scooping up samples with its robotic arm. With the samples sealed in a container, it will then reconnect with the returner for the trip back to Earth. The entire mission is set to last 53 days.China in 2020 returned samples from the moon\\'s near side, the first time anyone has done so since the U.S. Apollo program that ended in the 1970s. Analysis of the samples found they contained water in tiny beads embedded in lunar dirt.APRIL’S PINK MOON CAPTURED ON FULL DISPLAY OVER CHESAPEAKE BAYAlso in the past week, three Chinese astronauts returned home from a six-month mission on the country\\'s orbiting space station after the arrival of its replacement crew.China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely because of U.S. concerns over the Chinese military’s total control of the space program amid a sharpening competition in technology between the two geopolitical rivals. U.S. law bars almost all cooperation between the U.S. and Chinese space programs without explicit congressional approval.Faced with such limitations, China has expanded cooperation with other countries and agencies. The latest mission carries scientific instruments from France, Italy and the European Space Agency in cooperation with Sweden. A small Pakistani satellite is also on board.China’s ambitious space program aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2030, as well as bring back samples from Mars around the same year and launch three lunar probe missions over the next four years. The next is scheduled for 2027.Longer-term plans call for a permanent crewed base on the lunar surface, although those appear to remain in the conceptual phase.China conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, becoming the third country after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space using its own resources.The three-module Tiangong, much smaller than the ISS, was launched in 2021 and completed 18 months later. It can accommodate up to six astronauts at a time and is mainly dedicated to scientific research. The crew will also install space debris protection equipment, carry out payload experiments, and beam science classes to students on Earth.China has also said that it eventually plans to offer access to its space station to foreign astronauts and space tourists. With the ISS nearing the end of its useful life, China could eventually be the only country or corporation to maintain a crewed station in orbit.The U.S. space program is believed to still hold a significant edge over China’s due to its spending, supply chains and capabilities.The U.S. aims to put a crew back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025 as part of a renewed commitment to crewed missions, aided by private sector players such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. They plan to land on the moon\\'s south pole where permanently shadowed craters are believed to be packed with frozen water.'}\n",

To avoid this, follow this guide of essentials to bring with you.', 'content': \"A day at the theme park in the summer can bring hours of fun for the whole family, unless you are carrying a backpack stuffed almost to its breaking point.\\xa0If that's the case, a day of fun can quickly turn into one of exhaustion and frustration.\\xa0It's vital when packing your bag for the day to only bring the essentials. Keep in mind that if you carry a backpack with you, you'll want it to be small enough that it doesn't weigh you down and also fits inside a locker when you ride the coasters.\\xa0THEME PARK PASSES: TIPS AND TRICKS FOR MAKING THE MOST OF YOUR PURCHASESo, what are the essentials?\\xa0This guide is split up into the items you absolutely can't forget — and items that you may find helpful if you do have a little extra room to play with. Jump right in!Be sure to find a spot for sunscreen in your backpack. You're going to be spending the whole day, possibly multiple days, in the hot summer sun.\\xa0Even if you put on sunscreen in the morning before you go, you'll want to reapply throughout the day to ensure your skin doesn't burn.\\xa0Burnt shoulders will quickly make your day painful. If you don't have enough room in your bag for a full-sized bottle, you can always get a travel size instead.\\xa0Sunglasses are essential for a day at the theme park. You'll be spending the whole day outside, often stuck directly in the sun while waiting in line.\\xa0HOW TO WEAR SUNSCREEN THE RIGHT WAY: YOUR GUIDE TO SPFJust make sure not to leave your sunglasses on or on top of your head once you get on the ride, or else you'll likely lose them once it takes off.The best place to keep your sunglasses while you ride is safely tucked away in your bag or secured in a closed pocket.\\xa0When you're walking around with the heat surrounding you, a mini portable fan is going to save the day.\\xa0You can even get one that you wear around your neck if you don't want to hold it.\\xa0These fans are a perfect way to enjoy nice cool air as you make your way from ride to ride.\\xa0It's so important to stay hydrated while you are at an amusement park.\\xa0Collapsible water bottles are perhaps the best way to go, as they take up very little space in your bag.\\xa0Buying water at the parks is very expensive, so having your own bottle to refill will save you lots of money.HATE WATER? HERE ARE 5 HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES, ACCORDING TO AN NFL SPORTS DIETITIANMany amusement parks also offer guests souvenir cups that you can refill with your favorite soft drinks throughout the day.\\xa0These are a great option for a practical souvenir you can take home with you.\\xa0You'll want to have your license, credit card and some cash with you while at an amusement park, but a bulky wallet is less than ideal.\\xa0Find something slim that can slip into your bag with ease and fit only the essentials.\\xa0Amazon is full of slim wallets you can choose from for your travels.\\xa0Hungry children (and adults) are no fun at amusement parks. Let's face it, snacks at amusement parks are costly and can add a large expense to your vacation bill.\\xa0Granola bars, trail mix and fruit strips are great snacks to pack in your bag. Think of things like those that are small and that won't get crushed in your backpack.\\xa0FORMER DISNEY IMAGINEER SAYS THEME PARKS NOW MORE STRESSFUL, LESS FUN FOR FAMILIESBefore packing your snacks, make sure to check the food policy of the theme park you are visiting to make sure you won't have to dump any of your food upon entry.\\xa0Amusement parks are dirty places — so hand sanitizer is a must-have, especially before snacking.\\xa0Railings and lap bars on coasters are hot spots for germs, among many other places.\\xa0Make sure you have hand sanitizer and maybe even wet wipes with you to keep your hands clean throughout the day.\\xa0Chapped lips are not fun. This is such a small, easy item to add to your bag.\\xa0Make sure you have lip balm with SPF for extra sun protection.\\xa0Your hair is bound to be wind blown after a roller-coaster ride. Pack plenty of extra hairbands and clips. That way, you can tie up your hair quickly before you ride to avoid inevitable knots and tangles from leaving it down.\\xa0You're also probably going to want to tie up your hair after a few hours in the sun.\\xa0Accidents happen. If they do, you'll be prepared with Band-Aids packed neatly in your bag.\\xa0Blisters are common at amusement parks from walking around all day long.\\xa0Putting a Band-Aid over any blisters that form will keep you going through the day comfortably.\\xa0Check the weather forecast before you head to the park. If there's rain in the forecast, you're going to want a poncho.\\xa0Regular ponchos can take up a lot of space, but an individually wrapped poncho is slim and easy to fit into your bag.\\xa0Even if it's not going to rain, these are helpful to have on water rides, so your clothes don't get soaked.\\xa0This isn't an absolute necessity, as your phone battery is likely to be strong enough to last you the whole day. But, if you are an avid phone user, or your device has a short battery life, a portable phone charger is good to have.\\xa05 TIPS FOR FAMILY TRAVEL THAT COULD MAKE THE EXPERIENCE HAPPIER, HEALTHIER AND MUCH MORE MEMORABLEThere are lots of portable phone chargers that plug directly into your phone without any pesky cords needed. These are great space savers, and you can also easily use your phone while it charges.\\xa0A sweatshirt isn't a necessity, since most likely, it'll be hot most of the day. Consider bringing a sweatshirt only if you plan on staying in the park late, as the temperature will cool as the sun goes down.\\xa0These are going to take up a lot of space, so if you're willing, it may just be easier to purchase a sweatshirt from the gift shop if you get cold at night.\\xa0If you're going to be visiting a water park during your travels, a waterproof phone case is going to come in handy.\\xa0One of the best you can get is a clear pouch that you simply place your phone in and secure shut. These come with a lanyard, so you can wear your phone around your neck as you move about.\\xa0THE BIGGEST US THEME PARKS IN EVERY REGIONThese cases allow you to still see and use your phone while it's secure. These pouches float in the water, so if your phone comes off your neck, you'll very easily be able to spot it.\\xa0This may not be something you think to pack, but you'll be glad that you did.\\xa0There are a few different reasons why a fresh pair of socks can come in handy. The first is if you go on any water rides during your day in the park, such as a flume ride.If you're wearing socks and sneakers, and they get wet after a water ride, you're in for an uncomfortable rest of the day. Having an extra pair of socks to change into will make you a bit more comfortable.\\xa0Also, while walking around in hot temperatures, you're bound to get a little sweaty. Changing your socks at the halfway point of the day can help you feel (and smell) clean.\\xa0Speaking of smelling clean, a travel-sized deodorant can be a lifesaver when you are feeling sweaty at an amusement park.Swipe a little deodorant on and you'll feel brand new.\\xa0To avoid a hot scalp and the sun beaming in your eyes, keep a hat in your bag.\\xa0CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERThis also helps keep the hair out of your face throughout the day, while also hiding your coaster hair.\\xa0A bucket hat is a great option to have in your bag, since you can fold it up nice and small. You can also clip a baseball hat right onto your bag to save space.\\xa0Plastic bags are a multi-use item that can be extremely helpful at amusement parks.\\xa0If you get a snack, like popcorn, that you don't finish in one sitting, don't throw it away. Instead, put the remainder in a plastic bag so you can snack on it later.\\xa0Plastic bags are also a great holder of cash, coins and credit cards if you don't want to bring a wallet with you.\\xa0Just in case anyone you are traveling with gets motion sickness from all the rides, having some remedies packed with you isn't a bad idea.\\xa0Dramamine, motion sickness patches or bracelets are all options.\\xa0This is definitely not a necessity and more of a helpful tool.\\xa0Placing a cooling towel around your neck can fill you with relief from hot temperatures.\\xa0These usually come in a tube or bag, so you can put the wet towel right back in its container before placing it in your backpack to prevent all your other items from getting wet.\\xa0For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.\"}\n",

It makes sense. In the last 18 months alone, I’ve touched down on all seven continents. But don’t ask me about Türkiye if you’re in a hurry. Despite being a broke 25-year-old when I first visited 10 years ago, I will sing the destination’s praises until I lose my voice. Whether you’re looking for budget-friendly fun or a five-star sojourn (which I’m all about these days), Türkiye has it all. And thanks to\\xa0new nonstop flights from Detroit to Istanbul, it’s never been more accessible. Ideally, you can take a month off to criss-cross the country. But if you only have a week, or two, below is where I’d begin.\\xa0IstanbulIt’s hard not to fall head over heels for this seaside city that straddles two continents and was once the capital of three iconic empires. The locals are sincere, and even the street cats seem like they’re on holiday. Plus everything – from sipping your morning tea (served in a clear glass so you can enjoy the color) to bathing in an underground Turkish hammam – is an inviting experience. I learned the art of the barter in the bustling Grand Bazaar, took in 180-degree views of the Bosphorus from the Galata Tower, and house hunted in the effortlessly hip neighborhood of Karaköy because I wanted to move there so badly after just two nights. Despite being Catholic, I can’t deny that the Hagia Sophia is the most stunning house of worship I’ve ever stepped foot in.\\xa0Pro tip: Wear socks; shoes aren’t allowed in mosques.\\xa0BodrumA coastal city of contrasts, Bodrum is where the traditional wooden gulet I was on for an 8-night Sun Fun You cruise docked next to a multi-million dollar fiberglass yacht. This port city along the boasts Yalıkavak Marina, one of Europe’s finest marinas where you can shop in Dior and dine at Zuma. But it’s also home to the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. While exploring on foot – everywhere in the old town is walkable – I saw remnants of Bodrum’s previous life as a quiet fishing village. In the evenings, however, I drank and danced my way up Bar Street, a mile-long strip specializing in nightlife. And forget FOMO. Thanks to the laidback Turkaegean way of life, I was fully present and even the mundane moments felt magical.Pro tip: Don’t miss the \"Anatolia show\", where martial arts meet acrobats, at the city’s oldest club,\\xa0Halikarnas.\\xa0CappadociaCappadocia is more than the hot air balloon capital of the world. It’s rich in history (take a tour of Derinkuyu, a subterranean city dating back to the 7th century BCE, or explore Göreme’s mysterious cave churches) and chock full of geographic formations. From whimsical 100-foot-tall fairy chimneys to a snow-covered 12,851-foot-tall inactive volcano, this part of Central \\u200b\\u200bTürkiye\\xa0is made for the ‘gram. Here, it’s all about perspective, hence the hundreds of hot air balloon safaris that launch daily. Still, many think this magical landscape is best enjoyed on horseback. And don’t forget to embrace your inner sommelier and sample the region’s fine wines. Cappadocia’s fertile soil produces the rare Emir grape, among other renowned varieties.\\xa0Pro tip: Make your own ceramic souvenir at Avanos Pottery Workshop or shop for a hand-woven rug in Cappadocia’s colorful bazaars.\\xa0TrabzonA former Silk Road hub hugging the Black Sea and surrounded by mountains, Trabzon appeals to my inner adrenaline junkie. My bucket list includes paragliding over Uzungöl Lake, a popular alpine escape for adventurers, laying first tracks at Zigana Ski Centre, one of more than 40 ski resorts in the country, and hiking to the Sumela Monastery, a Greek Orthodox engineering marvel dating back to the 4th century CE. It’s carved out of a cliff and on clear days, offers breathtaking views of the always verdant Altindere Valley National Park below. Of course, no trip to Trabzon is complete without refueling with Akçaabat köftesi (fried meatballs).\\xa0Pro tip: If you’re not claustrophobic, go spelunking at Cal Cave, the self-proclaimed second-longest cave system in the world.\\xa0AntalyaThe beating heart of the Turkish Riviera is blessed with 231 Blue Flag Beaches. For comparison, the U.S. has just two. But there’s so much more to this resort-filled region than world-class sand and surf. Just 55 miles north of the city, a crystal clear river meanders through Köprülü Canyon National Park – a natural playground for rafters, campers, and hikers. Closer to town, the dramatic Duden Waterfalls are a popular place to picnic. The Lower Falls even cascade over a cliff into the sea. Antalya, with its Roman, Ottoman Turkish, Seljuk Turkish, and Eastern Roman influences, doesn’t disappoint in the culture department either. Its 2,000-year-old Aspendos – the best preserved theater from the ancient world – still hosts concerts, operas, and ballets. And Kaleiçi, Antalya’s old town, is a living, open-air museum.\\xa0Pro tip: Embrace your inner emperor and enter Kaleiçi through the triple-arched Hadrian’s Gate, built specifically for the Roman ruler’s visit in 130 CE.\\xa0Katie Jackson is a freelance travel writer.

            "{'title': 'Top 10 tips to maximize your iPhone’s battery life', 'description': 'Tech guru Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson explains how to maximize the life of an iPhone battery, which depends on chemical age, temperature and charge history.', 'content': 'There’s nothing worse than spending a lot of money on a nice new phone only to have a shortened battery life, curtailing its usefulness. Various factors can impact your iPhone’s battery life quality and quantity.\"Hi, if your iPhone is plugged in and finishes charging, does it damage [the] phone or charger if it is left plugged in at 100% during the night? Also, does leaving the charger plugged in when not in use hurt the charger? Thank you.\" — Gail, Clifton, NJThe short answer to your question is, \"Yes,\" Gail. While it may not damage your iPhone, it can impact the lifespan of your phone’s battery. Leaving your phone plugged in overnight is not a bad idea, as phones are smart enough to prevent an overload. Charging stops once the internal lithium-ion battery hits 100% of its capacity. However, if you leave your phone plugged in overnight, it will use a bit of energy by constantly trickling new juice into the battery every time it falls to 99%. That is eating into your phone’s lifespan.As for your second question, leaving your charger plugged in when not in use does not damage it. The charger will only draw power when connected to a device that needs charging, so you can leave it plugged in without worrying about damaging it.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE NEWSLETTER, THE CYBERGUY REPORTMost modern mobile phones are powered by lithium batteries, which are lighter, last longer, charge faster and have more power density. Battery life depends on its chemical age, based on its temperature and charge history. As the battery life chemically ages, the amount of charge the battery can hold is reduced. By staying mindful about how and how often you charge your phone, you can extend the life of your battery. Below are some ways to take care of your phone\\'s battery.HOW TO PROTECT IPHONES & IPADS FROM MALWAREMaximize your iPhone’s battery life and performance with these 10 essential tips to keep it running efficiently and safely.1. Do not let your iPhone overheat through external or internal temperature exposure. Make sure your phone isn’t overheating in its phone case while charging. If so, take it off to ensure enough ventilation around your phone.2. Try not to use your iPhone while it is charging. If you can wait until it is sufficiently charged, do wait because using your phone while charging can cause it to overwork, increasing the phone’s temperature and causing stress or damage.5 WAYS TO CHARGE YOUR MOBILE DEVICE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE3. Avoid buying cheap wall plug chargers. While buying the ones half the price is tempting, the officially branded wall plug chargers are manufactured with circuits specially created for your phone that prevent overcharging, breaking or overheating.BEST ACCESSORIES FOR YOUR PHONE4. I recommend not downloading battery performance apps from third parties. Most phones already come with this data, and these additional apps are draining their batteries. They can also be a risk for malware, viruses and bloatware.5. Be sure to turn off ‘Background App Refresh’ for apps you don’t need running all the time or selectively when your battery life is low.ASK ANY TECH QUESTION, AND GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER HEREWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?6. Use only official chargers and cables. If you must shop third-party brands, make sure they are Apple MFi certified for non-Apple accessories and USB-IF certified to replace Android accessories.7. Use the optimized battery charging option on your iPhone. It will help reduce the wear on your iPhone’s battery by lowering the time it stays fully charged. When this option is utilized, it will prevent your phone from charging past 80%. It learns your battery use habits to determine how long it takes to charge your phone. It’ll give you a scheduled time, which you can turn off if you need it charged fully sooner.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE8. Check which Apps and processes drain your battery. Most mobile devices include battery-use data. Once you can determine which apps or activities eat up most of your battery life, you can close them or use them less when you need to conserve battery life.9. Be careful of what portable battery chargers you use on the go. While they can be powerful and helpful in a pinch, some can cause damage. Buy from reputable Apple MFi-certified brands for non-Apple accessories and USB-IF certified to replace Android accessories.10. Adjust screen brightness. It is a simple way to conserve battery life by turning down the brightness on your phone.MORE: BEST PORTABLE PHONE CHARGERS OF 2024There are many ways to preserve your phone\\'s battery life.
