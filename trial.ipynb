She said she was forced to wait until she was diagnosed with a life-threatening case of sepsis before obtaining an abortion. She spent three days in intensive care and was left with a permanently closed fallopian tube from an infection, affecting her ability to have more children.</p><p>The court ruled Friday that state law does not require that a woman\\'s death or serious impairment be \"imminent\" when she is evaluated by a doctor for a potential abortion.</p><p>\"Ms. Zurawski\\'s agonizing wait to be ill \\'enough\\' for induction, her development of sepsis, and her permanent physical injury are not the results the law commands,\" the court wrote.</p><p>Zurawski said the ruling was \"heartbreaking.\"</p><p>\"I am outraged on behalf of my fellow plaintiffs who the Court deemed not sick enough,\" Zurawski said. \"We all deserve bodily autonomy.

The state Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s dismissal of that lawsuit, but the majority rejected arguments from voting rights groups that the measure violates state constitutional voting rights.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kansas-gov-kelly-call-special-legislative-session-tax-cuts\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>KANSAS GOV.

Voting rights groups, including Kansas League of Women Voters and the nonprofit Loud Light, argued the measure suppresses free speech and their ability to register voters as some might wrongly assume volunteers are election workers, putting them at risk of criminal prosecution.</p><p>A Shawnee County District Court judge had earlier rejected the groups\\' request for an emergency injunction, saying that impersonation of a public official is not protected speech.</p><p>But the high court faulted the new law, noting that it doesn\\'t include any requirement that prosecutors show intent by a voter registration volunteer to misrepresent or deceive people into believing they\\'re an election official, and it thus \"criminalizes honest speech\" where \"occasional misunderstandings\" are bound to occur, Stegall wrote in the majority opinion.</p><p>\"As such, it sweeps up protected speech in its net,\" Stegall said.</p><p>Because the lawsuit over the false impersonation law\\'s constitutionality is likely to succeed, the state Supreme Court ordered the lower court to reconsider issuing an emergency injunction against it.</p><p>\"For three years now, Kansas League of Women Voters volunteers have been forced to severely limit their assistance of voters due to this ambiguous and threatening law,\" said Martha Pint, president of the chapter. \"The League’s critical voter assistance work is not a crime, and we are confident this provision will be quickly blocked when the case returns to the district court.\"</p><p>Loud Light executive director Davis Hammet said he hopes the lower court \"will stop the irreparable harm caused daily by the law and allow us to resume voter registration before the general election.\"</p><p>Neither Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab nor state Attorney General Kris Kobach responded to requests for comment on that portion of the high court\\'s ruling.</p><p>Instead, in a joint statement, Schwab and Kobach focus on the high court\\'s language bolstering the signature verification law and its upholding of a provision that says individuals may collect no more than 10 advance ballots to submit to election officials.</p><p>\"This ruling allows us to preserve reasonable election security laws in Kansas,\" Schwab said.</p><p>Supporters have argued the ballot collection restriction combats \"ballot harvesting\" and limits voter fraud. The <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GOP-led Legislature</a> passed it over a veto by Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. Critics have said it\\'s a Republican reaction to baseless claims that the 2020 election was not valid, which prompted a wave of misinformation and voter suppression laws across the country.</p><p>Last year, the Kansas Court of Appeals reinstated a lawsuit challenging the ballot collection limitation and the signature verification, saying both impair the right to vote. But the high court upheld the limit on ballot collections, saying \"voters have numerous avenues available to deliver their ballots\" and that ballot collecting doesn\\'t fall within the parameters of free speech.</p><p>Kobach defended the majority\\'s opinion as \"well-reasoned\" and confirms that the Legislature has the constitutional authority to establish proofs \"to ensure voters are who they say they are.\"</p><p>\"And that is exactly what Kansas’s signature verification requirement is,\" Kobach said.</p>'}\n",

The few remaining birds were scattered in private collections around the world.</p><p>For the Spix\\'s macaws, immortalized in the popular animated \"Rio\" films, the road back from the edge of extinction has been a long, winding and bumpy one.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/scientists-endangered-species-act-essential-years-success\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SCIENTISTS SAY ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS AS ESSENTIAL AS EVER AFTER 50 YEARS OF SUCCESS</strong></a></p><p>Threats that had devastated the Spix’s macaws still loom, and the birds now face another menace: climate change.

It showed that northern Bahia state, including Curaca, where the Spix’s macaws are trying to survive, is now consistent with a desert area. It also identified the expansion of semi-arid climate in the Northeast, where nearly 55 million people live.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/lesser-known-endangered-species-us-threatened-funding-disparities\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>LESSER-KNOWN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE US THREATENED BY FUNDING DISPARITIES</strong></a></p><p>\"If the planet is warmer, there will be much greater evaporation. So, the water leaves the environment and generates aridity,\" the director of Brazil’s anti-desertification efforts, Alexandre Pires, told The Associated Press.</p><p>Since 2005, semi-arid area in Brazil has expanded by 116,000 square miles and is now roughly the size of three Californias. The government is set to announce measures to avoid desertification by promoting better management of soil and other natural resources in the region.</p><p>In the face of the changing climate and numerous challenges, at every turn the Purchases have dedicated the better part of their adult lives to breeding Spix\\'s macaws and reintroducing them into nature. The journey first took the biologists to work with a private collection on an oasis in Qatar. When the birds were sold to a nonprofit organization, the couple moved with them to Germany.</p><p>Over the past four years, their efforts have been centered in the rural area of Curaca, a nondescript town of 34,000 people.</p><p>Under an agreement between the Brazilian government and the German nonprofit Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, 52 Spix’s macaws were sent in 2020 to Brazil on two charter flights. Federal police escorted them to breeding and reintroduction facilities accessible by a 1-hour drive on a rough dirt road, where the Purchases live and work for the nonprofit.</p><p>The following year, 20 Spix’s macaws were released in the wild, along with 15 wild-sourced Blue-Winged macaws, whose purpose was to \"teach\" them how to fly, avoid risks and forage. Last year, two Spix’s macaw chicks were born in freedom — the first ones in decades— but they didn\\'t survive.</p><p>All released birds were equipped with radio collars designed to resist macaws’ strong bills. Each collar has an antenna. The Purchases and their assistant check the birds\\' locations three times a day.</p><p>Half of the Spix’s macaws have died, mostly from predation, or disappeared. Now, the remaining ones live within 3 miles of the facilities, a compound that includes the couple’s house and a U-shaped flight-and-release cage that\\'s 51 yards long.</p><p>In March, three more of the light pale blue chicks were born in the wild. Not only did they survive, but one of them also flew for the first time last week, a major breakthrough.</p><p>\"This event is so important as it shows how comfortable the parents are in their wild environment,\" Candice Purchase said in a text message. \"A remarkable achievement for the birds and an incredible success for the release.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-government-declares-rare-lizard-endangered-sparking-clash-environmentalists-oil-industry\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>US GOVERNMENT DECLARES RARE LIZARD ENDANGERED, SPARKING CLASH BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND OIL INDUSTRY</strong></a></p><p>To mitigate the impacts of desertification, the German parrot nonprofit partnered with a private company, Blue Sky Caatinga, to promote reforestation of 59,300 acres in the territory of Spix’s macaw. This initiative involves engaging small farmers who heavily depend on goat raising.</p><p>Unlike depictions in the animated films \"Rio\" and \"Rio 2,\" which brought attention to the Spix’s macaw extinction threat, the parrot’s natural habitat is far from Brazil’s most famous city, Rio de Janeiro, and the Amazon rainforest. It lives among the sparse, thorny, low caatinga vegetation that often loses greenery during dry periods. And the bird uses the Caraibeira, a towering evergreen tree that grows near small intermittent creeks, for nesting and food. During breeding season, the trees allow the pairs to conserve energy and avoid flying long distances to feed.</p><p>When the macaws first arrived <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/germany\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">from Germany</a>, they were offered various foods from the wild. \"We found that it took a while for the birds to recognize them as food,\" Purchase said. \"But the Caraibeira tree produces a seed pod, almost like helicopter seeds. The Spix’s had never seen anything like it before. We put those in the cages and some picked them up and immediately knew how to open them and eat the kernel inside, which was totally remarkable and took us by surprise.\"</p><p>The project also faces challenges outside the natural world. On May 15, the federal government informed the nonprofit that it would terminate the agreement, which expires on June 5. In a statement to the AP, Brazil\\'s federal environmental agency said it discovered that, in 2023, the nonprofit transferred Spix’s macaws from its center in Germany to other countries without its consent. The agreement will not be renewed until the situation is clarified, but the government said the nonprofit can continue its reintroduction work. The project\\'s funding comes from international donors.</p><p>The strained relations have put a pause on plans to release 20 parrots per year over 20 years. \"No release in 2023 and now looking like a 2024 release is unlikely. It would be a shame for the project to fail because of government politics,\" Purchase said.</p><p>There are approximately 360 <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/birds\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spix’s macaws</a> in captivity worldwide, with 46 in Curaca.</p><p>Despite the hurdles, many residents of Curaca, even if they never have never seen a Spix\\'s macaw, expect them to soon return to flying over the region and not just be seen in countless paintings that made the parrot part of the city\\'s identity.</p><p>\"The project is already a success.

They say they have found four basic components they think make up this phonetic alphabet.</p><p>Pratyusha Sharma, the paper\\'s lead researcher, said this alphabet could then be used by the whales in an unlimited number of combinations.</p><p>\"It doesn’t appear that they have a fixed set of codas,\" said Sharma, an artificial intelligence and computer science expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"That gives the whales access to a much larger communication system,\" she said, explaining it was as if the whales had a very large dictionary.</p><p>Sperm whales have the biggest brains of any animal on the planet at up to 20 pounds, as much as six times the size of an average human brain. Thy live in matriarchal groups of about 10 and sometimes meet up with hundreds or thousands of other whales. Sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet long and dive to nearly 3,280 feet to hunt for squid. They sleep vertically, in groups.</p><p>Gruber, a biology professor at the City University of New York, said sperm whales seem to have sophisticated social ties and deciphering their communication systems could reveal parallels with human language and society.</p><p>To get enough examples of the sperm whale clicks in Dominica, where there is a resident population of about 200 whales, scientists created a giant underwater recording studio with microphones at different depths. Tags on the whales also record what position they are in when clicking — for example diving, sleeping, breathing at the surface — and if there are any other whales nearby they might be communicating with.</p><p>Jeremy Goldbogen, an associate professor <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/environment/oceans\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">of oceans</a> at Stanford University, called the new research \"extraordinary,\" saying it had \"vast implications for how we understand ocean giants.\"</p><p>Goldbogen, who was not involved in the study, said that if we were one day able to understand what sperm whales were saying, that knowledge should be used for conservation purposes, like minimizing their risk of being hit by ships or reducing ocean noise levels.</p><p>Sperm whales are classified as \" vulnerable \" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The whales were hunted for centuries for the oil contained in their giant heads and the species is still recovering.</p><p>Diana Reiss, a marine mammal behavior and communication expert at the City University of New York, said that scientists understand certain aspects of marine animals\\' communication reasonably well, including the whistles used by dolphins and the songs sung by humpback whales.</p><p>But when it comes to sperm whales, even that basic knowledge is lacking.</p><p>\"What\\'s new in this study is that they are trying to look at the basis for the whales\\' communication system ... not just particular calls they\\'re making,\" she said.</p><p>Reiss, who was not involved in the new research, said she hoped we would one day be able to match the whales’ clicks to behavior.</p><p>\"We will never understand what the clicks mean to another whale, but we may be able to understand what the clicks mean enough to predict their behavior,\" she said. \"That alone would be an amazing achievement,\" she said.</p><p>CETI founder Gruber said millions and possibly billions of whale codas would be needed to collect enough data to try to work out what <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/mammals\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the whales</a> are saying, but he expects AI to help speed the analysis.

Plus, you get the added health benefits of spending time in nature.', 'content': '<p>Between the sweat smell, fluorescent lights and omnipresent television screens, April Herring has never connected with going to the gym.</p><p>Instead, she runs, bikes, hikes, plays tennis, pickleball and football — anything to get her exercise outside as often as possible.</p><p>\"Fresh air, sunshine, the variety of the trees as the seasons change,\" said Herring, an administrator at Carroll Community College in North Maryland. \"There’s something about the energetic healing quality of nature.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/fitness-gear-thats-comfortable\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>GET THIS FITNESS GEAR THAT’S ACTUALLY COMFORTABLE TO WORKOUT IN</strong></a></p><p>The health benefits of spending time in nature have long been established, and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/fitness-and-wellbeing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exercise in general</a>, of course, improves physical and mental well-being.</p><p>Combine the two and you double down on what adults need to stay healthy, said Debbie Rhea, professor in kinesiology at Texas Christian University.</p><p>\"We’ve got to get outside. We’ve got to be active,\" Rhea said. \"If we’re going to live long lives, this is what it’s about.\"</p><p>Getting started on an outdoor routine, however, might not be as easy as signing up for another gym membership. Here’s how to get going.</p><p>If you haven’t been active for a while, think back to the activities you enjoyed years ago, suggested Connie Sciolino, founder of the Alpine Training Center in Boulder, Colorado, a gym that trains athletes for outdoor mountain sports.</p><p>People who like occasionally hiking or biking should start building an aerobic base by taking progressively longer walks or rides. Once you’re comfortably in the 35- to 45-minute range, start adding some intensity to build strength, she said.</p><p>\"If jogging is their main activity, I would send them to the bleachers or do some up-down on stairs, either in sprint format or put a pack on their back,\" she said.</p><p>Rhea cautioned against jumping back into a sport you used to play without preparing your body for the proper movement.</p><p>\"Let’s say they’re in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and they haven’t sprinted and now they try to run around those bases,\" she said. \"They’re probably going to hurt an Achilles or a hamstring or something by doing something too fast.\"</p><p>A side benefit of exercising outside is that there’s no need to buy expensive equipment, trainers say.</p><p>After warming up with your preferred aerobic activity, add strength training by using your body weight and what is available in the built environment. That could be finding a picnic table or low wall and placing your hands shoulder-width apart to do leaning pushups. Then turn around, put your hands on the same surface and lower your body for dips that work your triceps.</p><p>For working your legs, add squats with your feet shoulder-width apart, looking straight ahead with your back straight. Add lunges by taking giant steps and bending down into the space between your feet. For the core, find a patch of grass to do sit-ups.</p><p>Start with eight to 10 repetitions, or no more than you are comfortable with, and add sets with short breaks in between as you get stronger.</p><p>For a more complete workout, find a park or trail with outdoor <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/fitness-items-work-out-small-apartment\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exercise equipment</a>, which is installed in one-third of park agencies, according to the National Recreation and Park Association. The equipment can range from basic pull-up bars to gym-style bench presses and rowing machines.</p><p>And many cities, including Chicago, San Antonio and Atlanta, offer free group classes outdoors.</p><p>When it inevitably rains or the weather turns colder, it helps to keep in mind an old axiom: There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.</p><p>\"If we have the clothing for whatever the temperatures are that we may be in, then we’re more likely to go outside to be active when we need to,\" Rhea said.</p><p>She suggested investing in a jacket that breathes and a light hat with a brim you can use on sunny or rainy days.</p><p>Trainer Katie Higginbotham recommended having a contingency plan for inclement weather. Pick an area with surfaces that won’t get slippery when wet or somewhere with some tree shelter so as not to be bombarded by rain.</p><p>On those days, having <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/story/how-to-choose-a-workout-buddy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a regular exercise buddy</a> really helps, said Higginbotham, who oversees quality control for TrainFitness, a U.K.-based private training provider.</p><p>\"If you know someone is there waiting for you, it’s difficult to say no at the last minute,\" she said.</p><p>Finally, it helps to set a goal, whether that is training for a 5K charity walk or a triathlon. If you’re working toward something, it keeps you motivated to keep going, Sciolino said.</p><p>\"When you have that day marked on your calendar, you have to perform these things or die out there,\" she said.</p>'}\n",

Three large dairy companies with tens of thousands of cows declined to comment on their procedures.</p><p>The workers - all based in New York, a major dairy producer - said they heard of the new illness affecting cattle through the media or community organizers, not their employers. One, 39-year-old Luis Jimenez from Mexico, said last week it was business as usual.</p><p>\"They\\'re not doing anything,\" he said.</p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April and May advised workers to use personal protective equipment (PPE) if they may be exposed to sick livestock, after a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/health/dairy-farm-worker-infected-bird-flu-cdc-urges-workers-wear-protective-gear\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Texas dairy worker tested positive</a> for bird flu. On May 6, the agency asked states to make equipment available to workers.</p><p>CDC wants \"to make sure that farm workers across the country, whether they are at a farm with an affected herd or not, have access to PPE,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, last week.</p><p>New York state said it is assessing CDC\\'s recommendation and has not yet distributed equipment. Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, where cattle were infected, said they distributed equipment to eight dairies combined. Kansas, Idaho and Wisconsin said they have equipment, but no farmers asked for it.</p><p>Michigan, where the second dairy worker tested positive, said many farms have protective gear but the state is coordinating a way to make it available for those that need more.</p><p>Dairies became more aware of bird flu\\'s risks in late April after the U.S. government began requiring that cows test negative before crossing state lines, said Emily Yeiser Stepp, who oversees a National Milk Producers Federation program that covers workforce development.</p><p>Still, \"reaching out into some of our rural networks takes a little longer,\" she said when told of workers who said they were not informed of recommendations for protective equipment.</p><p>The U.S. confirmed bird flu in dairy cattle in nine states.

In cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads.</p><p>Health experts advise dairy workers to wear gloves and disposable coveralls that can block milk splashes on their bodies or clothing.</p><p>Jimenez said his coworkers are under pressure to work so quickly that they sometimes do not have time to wash their hands before meals and often drive home in their work clothes.</p><p>Workers attach and detach milking equipment on cows, putting their faces close to unpasteurized milk. Most are immigrants and many do not have health insurance.</p><p>\"When you\\'re milking, splashes can\\'t be avoided. When it splashes in our eyes, we wash it out with water,\" said another New York worker, who requested anonymity because he is undocumented.</p><p>Lucas Sjostrom, a farmer and executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association, uses robotic machines to attach milking equipment to cows, but said he is being extra conscious that human workers wear gloves while transporting unpasteurized milk. Minnesota has not reported bird flu in cows.</p><p>In Indiana, another state without confirmed cases, farmer Steve Obert said he has not increased precautions for workers, though that could change if his herd tests positive. Extra protective equipment is not comfortable to wear, he added.</p><p>\"We\\'re rather isolated and I don\\'t think the risk is really great,\" said Obert, executive director of the industry group Indiana Dairy Producers.</p><p>The infected Texas worker suffered conjunctivitis and broken blood vessels that turned his eyes scarlet red, according to a photo published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He reported wearing gloves when working with cows but not respiratory or eye protection, the journal said.</p><p>Scientists are watching for changes in the virus that could make it spread more easily among humans. Epidemiologists said it could cause more serious illnesses if it mutates or infects someone with a compromised immune system.</p><p>Some dairies with infected cows have resisted allowing federal officials on their farms because of financial concerns, said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/health/cdc-webmd-give-update-current-bird-flu-outbreak-alert-not-alarmed\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The CDC said</a> it would like to test more farm workers, but it is not required.</p><p>New Mexico had anecdotal reports of workers with symptoms similar to conjunctivitis, but most were not tested, according to internal state documents that were dated April 26 and obtained by Reuters under a public records request. The workers were not tested because they did not seek healthcare, the New Mexico Department of Health said.</p><p>Policy changes are needed to encourage workers to seek treatment, such as emergency income assurance for those who test positive, said Brian Castrucci, an epidemiologist and CEO at health policy group the de Beaumont Foundation.</p><p>\"I don\\'t want to wait until we have a dead dairy farm worker until we ratchet up what we\\'re doing,\" he said.</p>'}\n",

If you don\\'t have enough room in your bag for a full-sized bottle, you can always get a travel size instead.\\xa0</p><p>Sunglasses are essential for a day at the theme park.

This is such a small, easy item to add to your bag.\\xa0</p><p>Make sure you have lip balm with SPF for extra sun protection.\\xa0</p><p>Your hair is bound to be wind blown after a roller-coaster ride. Pack plenty of extra hairbands and clips. That way, you can tie up your hair quickly before you ride to avoid inevitable knots and tangles from leaving it down.\\xa0</p><p>You\\'re also probably going to want to tie up your hair after a few hours in the sun.\\xa0</p><p>Accidents happen. If they do, you\\'ll be prepared with Band-Aids packed neatly in your bag.\\xa0</p><p>Blisters are common at amusement parks from walking around all day long.\\xa0</p><p>Putting a Band-Aid over any blisters that form will keep you going through the day comfortably.\\xa0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check the weather forecast</a> before you head to the park. If there\\'s rain in the forecast, you\\'re going to want a poncho.\\xa0</p><p>Regular ponchos can take up a lot of space, but an individually wrapped poncho is slim and easy to fit into your bag.\\xa0</p><p>Even if it\\'s not going to rain, these are helpful to have on water rides, so your clothes don\\'t get soaked.\\xa0</p><p>This isn\\'t an absolute necessity, as your phone battery is likely to be strong enough to last you the whole day. But, if you are an avid phone user, or your device has a short battery life, a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/tech\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">portable phone charger</a> is good to have.\\xa0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/5-tips-family-travel-could-make-experience-happier-healthier-more-memorable\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>5 TIPS FOR FAMILY TRAVEL THAT COULD MAKE THE EXPERIENCE HAPPIER, HEALTHIER AND MUCH MORE MEMORABLE</strong></a></p><p>There are lots of portable phone chargers that plug directly into your phone without any pesky cords needed. These are great space savers, and you can also easily use your phone while it charges.\\xa0</p><p>A sweatshirt isn\\'t a necessity, since most likely, it\\'ll be hot most of the day. Consider bringing a sweatshirt only if you plan on staying in the park late, as the temperature will cool as the sun goes down.\\xa0</p><p>These are going to take up a lot of space, so if you\\'re willing, it may just be easier to purchase a sweatshirt from the gift shop if you get cold at night.\\xa0</p><p>If you\\'re going to be visiting a water park during your travels, a waterproof phone case is going to come in handy.\\xa0</p><p>One of the best you can get is a clear pouch that you simply place your phone in and secure shut. These come with a lanyard, so you can wear your phone around your neck as you move about.\\xa0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/travel/biggest-theme-parks-in-every-region\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>THE BIGGEST US THEME PARKS IN EVERY REGION</strong></a></p><p>These cases allow you to still see and use your phone while it\\'s secure. These pouches float in the water, so if your phone comes off your neck, you\\'ll very easily be able to spot it.\\xa0</p><p>This may not be something you think to pack, but you\\'ll be glad that you did.\\xa0</p><p>There are a few different reasons why a fresh pair of socks can come in handy. The first is if you go on any water rides during your day in the park, such as a flume ride.</p><p>If you\\'re wearing socks and sneakers, and they get wet after a water ride, you\\'re in for an uncomfortable rest of the day. Having an extra pair of socks to change into will make you a bit more comfortable.\\xa0</p><p>Also, while walking around in hot temperatures, you\\'re bound to get a little sweaty. Changing your socks at the halfway point of the day can help you feel (and smell) clean.\\xa0</p><p>Speaking of smelling clean, a travel-sized deodorant can be a lifesaver when you are feeling sweaty at an amusement park.</p><p>Swipe a little deodorant on and you\\'ll feel brand new.\\xa0</p><p>To avoid a hot scalp and the sun beaming in your eyes, keep a hat in your bag.\\xa0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>This also helps keep the hair out of your face throughout the day, while also hiding your coaster hair.\\xa0</p><p>A bucket hat is a great option to have in your bag, since you can fold it up nice and small. You can also clip a baseball hat right onto your bag to save space.\\xa0</p><p>Plastic bags are a multi-use item that can be extremely helpful at amusement parks.\\xa0</p><p>If you get a snack, like popcorn, that you don\\'t finish in one sitting, don\\'t throw it away. Instead, put the remainder in a plastic bag so you can snack on it later.\\xa0</p><p>Plastic bags are also a great holder of <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/money\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cash, coins and credit cards</a> if you don\\'t want to bring a wallet with you.\\xa0</p><p>Just in case anyone you are traveling with gets motion sickness from all the rides, having some remedies packed with you isn\\'t a bad idea.\\xa0</p><p>Dramamine, motion sickness patches or bracelets are all options.\\xa0</p><p>This is definitely not a necessity and more of a helpful tool.\\xa0</p><p>Placing a cooling towel around your neck can fill you with relief from hot temperatures.\\xa0</p><p>These usually come in a tube or bag, so you can put the wet towel right back in its container before placing it in your backpack to prevent all your other items from getting wet.\\xa0</p><p><i><strong>For more Lifestyle articles, visit </strong></i><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><i><strong>www.foxnews.com/lifestyle</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>'}\n",

            "{'title': '5 Amazing places to visit in Türkiye, according to an American', 'description': 'From the mountains to the sea, 5 unforgettable places in Türkiye', 'content': '<p>People love asking travel writers like me for recommendations on where to go. It makes sense. In the last 18 months alone, I’ve touched down on all seven continents. But don’t ask me about <a href=\"https://goturkiye.com/?utm_source=fox_news&amp;utm_medium=CPM_&amp;utm_campaign=go_turk%C4%B1ye&amp;utm_content=go_turk%C4%B1ye&amp;utm_term=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Türkiye</a> if you’re in a hurry. Despite being a broke 25-year-old when I first visited 10 years ago, I will sing the destination’s praises until I lose my voice. Whether you’re looking for budget-friendly fun or a five-star sojourn (which I’m all about these days), Türkiye has it all. And thanks to\\xa0new nonstop flights from Detroit to Istanbul, it’s never been more accessible. Ideally, you can take a month off to criss-cross the country. But if you only have a week, or two, below is where I’d begin.\\xa0</p><p><strong>Istanbul</strong></p><p>It’s hard not to fall head over heels for this seaside city that straddles two continents and was once the capital of three iconic empires. The locals are sincere, and even the street cats seem like they’re on holiday. Plus everything – from sipping your morning tea (served in a clear glass so you can enjoy the color) to bathing in an underground Turkish hammam – is an inviting experience. I learned the art of the barter in the bustling Grand Bazaar, took in 180-degree views of the Bosphorus from the Galata Tower, and house hunted in the effortlessly hip neighborhood of Karaköy because I wanted to move there so badly after just two nights. Despite being Catholic, I can’t deny that the Hagia Sophia is the most stunning house of worship I’ve ever stepped foot in.\\xa0</p><p><i>Pro tip:</i> Wear socks<i>; shoes aren’t allowed in mosques.\\xa0</i></p><p><strong>Bodrum</strong></p><p>A coastal city of contrasts, Bodrum is where the traditional wooden gulet I was on for an 8-night Sun Fun You cruise docked next to a multi-million dollar fiberglass yacht. This port city along the boasts Yalıkavak Marina, one of Europe’s finest marinas where you can shop in Dior and dine at Zuma. But it’s also home to the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. While exploring on foot – everywhere in the old town is walkable – I saw remnants of Bodrum’s previous life as a quiet fishing village. In the evenings, however, I drank and danced my way up Bar Street, a mile-long strip specializing in nightlife. And forget FOMO. Thanks to the laidback Turkaegean way of life, I was fully present and even the mundane moments felt magical.</p><p><i>Pro tip: Don’t miss the \"Anatolia show\", where martial arts meet acrobats, at the city’s oldest club,\\xa0Halikarnas.\\xa0</i></p><p><strong>Cappadocia</strong></p><p>Cappadocia is more than the hot air balloon capital of the world. It’s rich in history (take a tour of Derinkuyu, a subterranean city dating back to the 7th century BCE, or explore Göreme’s mysterious cave churches) and chock full of geographic formations. From whimsical 100-foot-tall fairy chimneys to a snow-covered 12,851-foot-tall inactive volcano, this part of Central \\u200b\\u200bTürkiye\\xa0is made for the ‘gram. Here, it’s all about perspective, hence the hundreds of hot air balloon safaris that launch daily. Still, many think this magical landscape is best enjoyed on horseback. And don’t forget to embrace your inner sommelier and sample the region’s fine wines. Cappadocia’s fertile soil produces the rare Emir grape, among other renowned varieties.\\xa0</p><p><i>Pro tip: Make your own ceramic souvenir at Avanos Pottery Workshop or shop for a hand-woven rug in Cappadocia’s colorful bazaars.\\xa0</i></p><p><strong>Trabzon</strong></p><p>A former Silk Road hub hugging the Black Sea and surrounded by mountains, Trabzon appeals to my inner adrenaline junkie. My bucket list includes paragliding over Uzungöl Lake, a popular alpine escape for adventurers, laying first tracks at Zigana Ski Centre, one of more than 40 ski resorts in the country, and hiking to the Sumela Monastery, a Greek Orthodox engineering marvel dating back to the 4th century CE. It’s carved out of a cliff and on clear days, offers breathtaking views of the always verdant Altindere Valley National Park below. Of course, no trip to Trabzon is complete without refueling with Akçaabat köftesi (fried meatballs).\\xa0</p><p><i>Pro tip: If you’re not claustrophobic, go spelunking at Cal Cave, the self-proclaimed second-longest cave system in the world.\\xa0</i></p><p><strong>Antalya</strong></p><p>The beating heart of the Turkish Riviera is blessed with 231 Blue Flag Beaches. For comparison, the U.S. has just two. But there’s so much more to this resort-filled region than world-class sand and surf. Just 55 miles north of the city, a crystal clear river meanders through Köprülü Canyon National Park – a natural playground for rafters, campers, and hikers. Closer to town, the dramatic Duden Waterfalls are a popular place to picnic. The Lower Falls even cascade over a cliff into the sea. Antalya, with its Roman, Ottoman Turkish, Seljuk Turkish, and Eastern Roman influences, doesn’t disappoint in the culture department either. Its 2,000-year-old Aspendos – the best preserved theater from the ancient world – still hosts concerts, operas, and ballets. And Kaleiçi, Antalya’s old town, is a living, open-air museum.\\xa0</p><p><i>Pro tip: Embrace your inner emperor and enter Kaleiçi</i> <i>through the triple-arched Hadrian’s Gate, built specifically for the Roman ruler’s visit in 130 CE.\\xa0</i></p><p><i>Katie Jackson is a freelance travel writer.

The wording suggests the company didn’t have direct access to the leaked database. Still, the post revealed plenty of information about the incident and the threat actors behind the attack.</p><p>The hacking groups EquationCorp and USDoD are reportedly responsible for a major data breach involving the criminal record database. The breach, which resulted in the online leak of the database, contains 70 million entries.

Each entry represents either an arrest or a case rather than a comprehensive compilation of all crimes committed by a single person. In other words, these records provide a snapshot of discrete legal events rather than a comprehensive overview of an individual’s criminal history.\\xa0</p><p>The exact source of this database is unknown.

Invest in identity theft protection: </strong>If you think your personal data has been leaked, scammers may try to impersonate you to gain access to your private information. The best thing you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service.</p><p>Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.

While it may not damage your iPhone, it can impact the lifespan of your phone’s battery. Leaving your phone plugged in overnight is not a bad idea, as phones are smart enough to prevent an overload. Charging stops once the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">internal lithium-ion battery</a> hits 100% of its capacity. However, if you leave your phone plugged in overnight, it will use a bit of energy by constantly trickling new juice into the battery every time it falls to 99%. That is eating into your phone’s lifespan.</p><p>As for your second question, leaving your charger plugged in when not in use does not damage it.

Picture yourself zipping through the streets, dodging those bumper-to-bumper blues and the headache of finding a parking spot.</p><p>Now, imagine a ride that’s as zippy as a bike but with the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">comfort of a car</a>, and guess what? It’s all green, too. That’s the Hopper for you — it’s like the cool hybrid of getting around town that’s about to flip the script on urban travel.</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/newsletter/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER — THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE</u></strong></a>\\xa0</p><p>Born from a 2020 concept by the innovative minds at Hamburg-based startup Hopper Mobility, the Hopper is a semi-enclosed three-wheeler that is <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/germany\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">turning heads in Germany</a>. It’s not just any ebike; it’s a sleek, car-like machine that offers protection from the elements while keeping you active.</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/how-to/how-to-get-rid-of-robocalls-with-apps-and-data-removal-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>HOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES</u></strong></a></p><p>Legally, the Hopper is an ebike, which means it can dodge traffic by cruising in bike lanes. But don’t be fooled — it can hold its own on the road, too. The Hopper’s pedal power is boosted by a 250-watt rear hub motor, propelling it to speeds of up to 16 mph. And with a 30-Ah/48V/1,440-Wh lithium-iron-phosphate battery, you’re looking at a range of 40 miles per charge. Need more? Slap on the optional solar panel for an extra boost.</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/travel/car-boat-combo-that-can-hit-road-or-water-with-same-vehicle/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>A CAR-BOAT COMBO THAT CAN HIT THE ROAD OR THE WATER WITH THE SAME VEHICLE\\xa0</u></strong></a></p><p>Ditching the traditional chain drive, the Hopper uses a pedal-by-wire system, where your pedaling generates electricity that powers the motor. It’s a smooth, maintenance-free ride that’s kind to the planet.</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/top-stories/electric-cargo-bike-aims-to-replace-your-suv/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>ELECTRIC CARGO BIKE AIMS TO REPLACE YOUR SUV</u></strong></a></p><p>Whether you’re carrying a friend or hauling cargo, the Hopper has you covered. Choose the Passenger model for a cozy second seat or the Cargo model with a 300-liter lockable compartment. Despite its lightweight frame of 265 lbs., it can handle a hefty 353 lbs. of passengers or payload.</p><p>The Hopper features a full lighting system, a touchscreen control center on the steering wheel, a windshield defogger, a security system and even USB ports for your gadgets. And soon, you’ll be able to seal off the sides for those extra chilly days.</p><p>The Hopper is designed with safety in mind, offering many safety features that make it reliable on the road. Its semi-enclosed structure provides a layer of protection from the elements and road hazards while still keeping the ride enjoyable and active.</p><p>The Hopper’s design includes a large windscreen and a roof, ensuring visibility and shelter. Its compact dimensions allow for easy maneuvering through traffic, reducing the risk of accidents. The vehicle’s stability is enhanced by its tadpole trike configuration, with two 20-inch bicycle tires at the front and a 10-inch scooter tire at the rear, offering a balanced and secure ride.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/pilot-passengers-skydiving-flight-jump-small-plane-crashes-missouri-hayfield\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PILOT, 6 PASSENGERS ON SKYDIVING FLIGHT JUMP BEFORE SMALL PLANE CRASHES IN MISSOURI HAYFIELD</strong></a></p><p>Moreover, the Hopper’s pedal-by-wire system eliminates the need for a traditional chain drive, reducing maintenance concerns and potential mechanical failures. The full lighting system ensures you’re seen on the road, and the touchscreen control center keeps all your navigation and vehicle controls within easy reach, minimizing distractions.</p><p>With about 30 prototypes already cruising German streets, the Hopper has benefited from real-world feedback, shaping the First Edition, which is now available for preorder at $14,677. As production ramps up later this year, keep an eye out — this urban vehicle might just be the future of city commuting.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products\"><strong>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</strong></a></p><p>While the company\\'s current focus is on German streets, it has its sights set on a broader horizon, actively exploring opportunities to bring the Hopper to customers around the globe.

And let\\'s not forget, it\\'s an eco-friendly ride to boot. While it may turn some heads with its unique design, the Hopper could very well be a glimpse into the future of city commuting. With real-world testing already underway in Germany, the Hopper is more than just a concept — it\\'s a vehicle you can actually pre-order now.

It’s understandable that you want to protect your online privacy and security by using a VPN. However, it’s true that some websites block VPN connections to prevent fraudulent activities and protect their own security. Below are the reasons why VPN connections are blocked and how to circumvent that.</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/newsletter/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE NEWSLETTER, THE CYBERGUY REPORT</u></strong></a></p><p>Major paid VPN services invest significant resources into evading VPN blocking by websites and services. Their server networks are large and constantly rotating IP addresses, making it harder to blacklist.</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/are-free-vpns-safe/\"><u>Free VPN </u></a><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/are-free-vpns-safe/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>services</u></a> tend to have smaller server networks and get their IP address ranges blacklisted more easily by anti-VPN measures.

However, it’s important to note that websites have the right to block VPN connections if they suspect fraudulent activities. This is because VPNs can be used to mask the identity of the user and bypass geographical restrictions, which can be used for illegal activities. Below are the top four reasons VPN connections are blocked.</p><p><strong>1) Transparency: </strong>Financial institutions, in particular, often block VPNs because they want to preserve the transparency of transactions. In short, these institutions have a vested interest in seeing where and who the funds are coming and going. PayPal actually will go as far as to ban VPN users for life as it violates their Terms of Service agreements.</p><p><strong>2) Limiting services:</strong> Streaming services do not want users to use VPN because it bypasses specific region-based restrictions. Certain content is only available to specific regions of the world, and VPN would mask the user\\'s location.\\xa0Streaming services actively block VPN IP addresses, and if it is discovered you managed to bypass their IP blacklists with a regular VPN or VPN obfuscation, you can come under \"fire\" from the streaming services.</p><p><strong>3) Preventing illegal activities:</strong> Some governments and companies utilize VPN blocking to ensure that they are protected against misuse, fraud, and other illegal activities.</p><p><strong>4) Control:</strong> Some governments and companies use VPN blocking to monitor and trace back activities by individuals online. For instance, some companies ban VPN use, limiting nonwork access online, etc.</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>ASK ANY TECH QUESTION AND GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER HERE</u></strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-secure-your-hotspot-privacy-and-security-with-vpn/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>MORE: HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOT SPOT PRIVACY, SECURITY WITH VPN</u></strong></a></p><p>One effective way to bypass VPN blocking is to connect to a different VPN server location or city. Many websites and services that attempt to block VPNs do so by blacklisting known VPN IP address ranges. By switching to a VPN server in a different city or country, you can obtain a new IP address that may not be blocked.</p><p>Most reputable VPN providers have a large global server network spanning hundreds or thousands of servers across dozens of countries. This gives you many options to try different server locations until you find one that is not blocked by the website or service you\\'re trying to access.</p><p>The steps are usually:</p><p>By changing your virtual location frequently, you make it much harder for anti-VPN measures to keep up with blacklisting all the IP addresses associated with a particular VPN service.</p><p>Consider using a VPN to protect against being tracked and to identify your potential location on websites that you visit.\\xa0Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding.

In this particular scam, scammers send their victims phishing emails pretending to send them a large invoice for their Geek Squad subscription. The email recipients usually panic at the large charge and call the customer service telephone number listed in the scam email and invoice.\\xa0</p><p>The scammer then pretends to be the customer service representative helping to cancel or refund the charge. They’ll usually use that moment as an opportunity to confirm <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/banking\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bank account information</a> with the victim to steal their money later. Even if you simply click on their links or download the invoice from the email, there is a potential risk that viruses or malware have been downloaded onto your device.\\xa0</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/privacy/the-unsubscribe-email-scam-is-targeting-americans/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>MORE: THE ‘UNSUBSCRIBE’ EMAIL SCAM IS TARGETING AMERICANS</u></strong></a></p><p>The elderly victim gave her bank account number and remote access to her computer. The scam, however, doesn’t just stop there. The scammer went a step further and proceeded to convince this elderly woman that they had accidentally refunded a fake $25,000 into her bank account by mistake and that he needed her to withdraw $20,000 in cash initially for him to pick up with arrangements to pick up the remaining $5,000 the following day. This is when the elderly woman called her <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">local authorities</a>. Thankfully, the authorities set up surveillance and apprehended the scammer when he came to collect the $20,000.\\xa0</p><p>Perhaps the elderly victim lucked out that this scammer had an extra level of greed: combining multiple scams into one.\\xa0</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/how-to/7-effective-ways-make-your-life-more-secure-private-online/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>MORE: 7 EFFECTIVE WAYS TO MAKE YOUR LIFE MORE SECURE AND PRIVATE ONLINE</u></strong></a></p><p><strong>Know your subscriptions:</strong> The better you know what active subscriptions you currently pay for, the less likely you are to realize such emails are fake.\\xa0</p><p><strong>Organize your invoices:</strong> If you’re still receiving emails or physical invoices, keep track of when they usually arrive. Invoices, for better or worse, come regularly and on a consistent schedule. If something shows up in an unusual form (an email instead of a letter in the mail per usual) or at a particular time, you are more likely to stop yourself from falling for this type of scam.</p><p><strong>Go to the official website for contact information. </strong>If the scammers happen to pick a company that you do subscribe to, it can be even easier to fall for this type of scam. But before clicking any links, downloading any invoices or calling the number listed, you can google the company’s official website and use the contact information there. If the company did indeed send you a bill, they should be able to help you with the refund or confirm whether you were sent legitimate communications.</p><p><strong>Watch for language and tone of voice:</strong> Most legitimate companies go out of their way to specially train their employees to provide their customers with excellent service. They are trained not to lose their temper, so if you happen to be on a call with a scammer, they often don’t use professional language or have a professional demeanor. If you push back on providing certain information, a real customer service agent wouldn’t make any threats or demands. Providing Social Security numbers or bank account information is usually frowned upon for security reasons by legitimate companies. Legitimate companies typically have other ways to validate your identity and account information. You can always hang up the phone if you get overwhelmed on a call! After all, an honest company doesn’t disappear after one disconnection.\\xa0</p><p><strong>Setup payments electronically:</strong> If you have your subscriptions paid electronically on a regular basis, you’ll know that you shouldn’t be receiving an additional invoice for a subscription service. Additionally, if you are paying with a credit card, you can try to use a specific card for all your subscriptions so you know where and when to expect the charges. You’ll also know that certain bank information shouldn’t be relevant to paying an invoice if you get one of these phishing emails. For instance, why is the scammer asking for bank account information when you charge your subscriptions on a credit card, etc.?</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>ASK OUR TECH EXPERT ANY QUESTION, AND GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER HERE</u></strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/tech/scammers-are-using-fake-news-malicious-links-to-target-you-emotional-facebook-phishing-trap\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SCAMMERS ARE USING FAKE NEWS, MALICIOUS LINKS TO TARGET YOU IN AN EMOTIONAL FACEBOOK PHISHING TRAP</strong></a></p><p>These scammers could have obtained your email address through various methods, from email harvesting to purchasing it from the <a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/steps-delete-personal-information-dark-web/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>dark web</u></a>; below are some active steps you can take to protect yourself if you feel you have been scammed:</p><p><strong>1. Change passwords: </strong>For any accounts that might have been accessed or mentioned to or by the scammer, you should log in from a secure, virus- and malware-free device and change your password immediately. It is best to create unique and complex passwords, including letters, symbols and numbers, for each separate online account. If you need help generating and storing complex passwords, consider using a <a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/best-password-managers/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>password manager</u></a>.</p><p><strong>2. Keep an eye on all your accounts and credit consistently: </strong>Contact the financial institution and explain the situation for all accounts impacted by the potential scammer. They can help you freeze or lock your account, so these scammers have little or no access to your money. Contact the three main credit bureaus to freeze your credit. This will prevent anyone, including hackers, from wreaking havoc on your credit. Make sure to report any errors on your credit reports with the credit agencies. Remember that you are allowed a free annual credit report. If there are too many accounts for you to keep track of regularly, a <a href=\"http://cyberguy.com/identitytheft\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>credit monitoring service</u></a> can help by constantly monitoring and alerting you of any account changes or problems.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</strong></a></p><p><strong>3. Setup alerts for financial accounts: </strong>Most financial institutions offer financial alerts or restrictions for all transactions for checking accounts and cards. Do use them so you can be notified of any fraudulent transactions immediately. The faster you can report these charges to your financial institution, the more likely you can stop the scammers in their tracks.</p><p><strong>4. Enable </strong><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/how-to/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-why-should-i-enable-it/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>two-factor authentication</u></strong></a><strong> for any account impacted by the phishing scam: </strong>This would include your financial accounts and email address. If you have this additional layer of security on, the hacker or scammer would have to send a code to another device or account to gain access, even with your password.\\xa0</p><p><strong>5. Get Identity Theft Protection: </strong>While getting an identity theft service seems overkill, many identity theft protection services can help you when your accounts get compromised. They continually monitor the dark web and your financial accounts to see if any crucial personal information like your email addresses or bank account information is compromised or up for sale on the dark web. Getting those alerts immediately allows you to act faster and take the above-mentioned steps.\\xa0If you have already given out your information to a potential scammer, you should follow these steps to ensure that your identity hasn’t been stolen. <a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/security/best-identity-theft-protection-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.</u></a></p><p><strong>6. Use strong antivirus software:</strong> If you have antivirus software installed on the device where the scam email was received and any links clicked or attachments downloaded, run a scan on that device to identify suspicious software, delete it, and restart your device. <a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/security/best-antivirus-protection/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android &amp; iOS devices</u></a>.</p><p><strong>7. Call the local authorities: </strong>While you hope never to encounter a scammer like the elderly woman who was victimized, if you feel unsafe and uncertain about how scammers will use your information, definitely reach out to local authorities.\\xa0</p><p><a href=\"https://cyberguy.com/privacy/dont-click-that-link-how-to-spot-prevent-phishing-attacks-in-your-inbox/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>DON’T CLICK THAT LINK!

And, if you\\'re near retirement or already retired, learning a new skill helps keep the mind sharp and maybe even gives you the education you need to start a new venture.</p><p>Choosing the best online course depends on several factors.

He was 74.The Correctional Service of Canada said in statement that Pickton, an inmate of Port-Cartier Institution in the province of Quebec, died in hospital following injuries in the May 19 assault involving another inmate. He was one of Canada’s most notorious serial killers and his case made international headlines.A CANADIAN SERIAL KILLER WHO BROUGHT VICTIMS TO A PIG FARM IS HOSPITALIZED AFTER A PRISON ASSAULTA 51-year-old inmate was in custody for the assault on Pickton, police spokesman Hugues Beaulieu said earlier this month.Robert \"Willie\" Pickton was convicted of six counts of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2007, with the maximum parole ineligibility period of 25 years, after being charged with the murders of 26 women.Police began searching the Pickton farm in the Vancouver suburb of Port Coquitlam more than 22 years ago in what would be a years-long investigation into the disappearances of dozens of women from Vancouver’s seediest streets, sex workers and drug addicts abandoned on the margins of society.The remains or DNA of 33 women were found on the farm. Pickton once bragged to an undercover police officer that he killed a total of 49 women.During his trial, prosecution witness Andrew Bellwood said Pickton told him how he strangled his victims and fed their remains to his pigs. Health officials once issued a tainted meat advisory to neighbors who might have bought pork from Pickton’s farm, concerned the meat might have contained human remains.Cynthia Cardinal, whose sister Georgina Papin was murdered by Pickton, said Pickton’s death means she can finally move on from her sister’s murder.\"This is gonna bring healing for, I won’t say all families, I’ll just say most of the families,\" she said. \"I’m like — wow, finally. I can actually move on and heal and I can put this behind me.\"Vancouver police were criticized for not taking the cases seriously because many of the missing were sex workers or drug users.Canada\\'s correctional service said it was conducting an investigation into the attack on Pickton.\"The investigation will examine all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the assault, including whether policies and protocols were followed,\" the service said in the statement. \"We are mindful that this offender’s case has had a devastating impact on communities in British Columbia and across the country, including Indigenous peoples, victims and their families.

Gangs in Mexico depend on controlling local police chiefs, and taking a share of municipal budgets; national politics appear to interest them less.ALMOST 2 MONTHS AFTER EMBASSY RAID, ECUADOR IS READY TO TALK WITH MEXICO AND REACH SOLUTIONBut in the runup to Sunday’s vote, gangs have increasingly taken to spraying whole campaign rallies with gunfire, burning ballots or preventing the setting up of polling stations — even putting up banners seeking to influence voters.Security analyst David Saucedo says it\\'s likely some drug gangs will try to force voters to cast ballots for their favored candidates.\"It it is reasonable to assume that the cartels will mobilize their support bases during Sunday\\'s elections,\" Saucedo said. \"They have loyal voters who they have won over through the distribution of food packages, cash, medicine and infrastructure projects. They will use them to support narco-candidates.\"In some places, it appears the gangs are encouraging people to vote while discouraging voting in areas controlled by their rivals.On Friday, electoral authorities reported that assailants burned a house where ballots were being stored ahead of Sunday in the violence-wracked town of Chicomuselo, in the southern state of Chiapas. While they did not say who was behind the attack, the town is completely dominated by two warring drug cartels, Jalisco and Sinaloa.On May 14, gunmen apparently linked to a cartel shot and killed 11 people in a single day in Chicomuselo. On May 17, five people were killed along with a mayoral candidate when gunmen opened fire on a crowd in the town of La Concordia, Chiapas, about 45 miles (75 kilometers) east of Chicomuselo.Targeted assassinations of local candidates continued. On Wednesday, dramatic video images showed a mayoral candidate in the southern state of Guerrero being shot in the head at point-blank rage with a pistol.And mass attacks on campaign rallies, once exceedingly rare in Mexico, are becoming common.Also on Wednesday, the last official day of campaigning, unidentified gunmen opened fire a couple of blocks away from a mayoral candidate\\'s final campaign rally in the western state of Michoacan, sending hundreds of people scrambling for safety.\"It seemed like a normal evening, like the campaign closers of other candidates,\" said Angélica Chávez, a homemaker who was at the rally in Cotija. \"Then there were gunshots, several rounds of gunfire very close. And then people started running and diving to the ground, crouching.\"Chávez was hurt in the stampede and had to take refuge in a local church.In Celaya, a city in Guanajuato, gunmen opened fire on a campaign event in April, killing a mayoral candidate and wounding three of her supporters.Saucedo, the analyst, sees the shootings as a sign that narco gangs are no longer willing to see their handpicked candidates lose.\"Rather than allow the victory of a candidate who is not in line with their criminal interests, or allow a candidate linked to a rival drug gang to win, they use this tactic,\" Saucedo said. \"What we\\'re seeing in the final stretch is pretty desperate strategy on the part of some groups of drug traffickers.\"Saucedo said that such attempts at narco-control of local politics had been seen previously in some particularly violent states, like Tamaulipas. \"What was once limited ... is now spreading to include the whole country,\" he said.The National Electoral Institute says it has had to cancel plans for 170 polling places, mostly in Chiapas and Michoacan and mostly because of security problems. In Chiapas, electoral authorities say there are places they can\\'t even go to.In the northern border city of Nuevo Laredo, a shadowy group that local media reports link to the dominant Northeast drug cartel has put up posters claiming one mayoral candidate is linked to the rival Gulf drug cartel.Authorities have not confirmed the origin of the crude poster, which includes a photoshopped image of the candidate waving an assault rifle and wearing a bulletproof vest with the Gulf cartel\\'s insignia.In the state of Morelos, just south of Mexico City, residents awoke this week to find a banner strung over a road claiming a gubernatorial candidate was tied to rival drug gangs. The banner was signed by a local drug boss whose name is unknown, \"the Commander of the Three Letters.\"Another apparently gang-related banner threatened that anyone trying to buy votes would be \"punished severely.\" That banner was signed by \"Those who have always called the shots here.\"Such events appear to indicate that past calculations by the cartels — take out the strongest candidate you don\\'t like, and the remaining major-party candidate will win by default — have become more complicated.In one town in Michoacan, Maravatio, the gangs apparently tried to eliminate any doubts as to who will win this year and killed off three candidates for town mayor who were not to their liking.'}\n",

Security Council voted unanimously Friday to end the U.N. political mission in Iraq established in 2003 following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein to coordinate post-conflict humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, and to help restore a representative government in the country.The Iraqi government asked the council in a May 8 letter to wrap up the mission by the end of 2025 and that’s what the resolution does: It extends the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, known as UNAMI, for a final 19 months until Dec. 31, 2025 when all its work will cease.IRAQ ASKS UN TO ABANDON POLITICAL MISSION IN BAGHDADThe U.S.-sponsored resolution asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to prepare \"a transition and liquidation plan\" in consultation with the Iraqi government by Dec. 31, 2024 so UNAMI can start transferring its tasks and withdrawing staff and assets.The council said it supports Iraq’s continuing stabilization efforts including its ongoing fight against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida extremists and their affiliates.In 2014, the Islamic State group declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria and attracted tens of thousands of supporters from around the world. The extremists were defeated by a U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria in 2019, but its sleeper cells remain in both countries.The council’s action came as Iraq is also seeking to wind down the military coalition formed to fight the IS. The roughly 2,500 U.S. troops are scattered around the country, largely in military installations in Baghdad and in the north. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has contended that the Iraqi security forces are capable of dealing with the remaining IS cells in the country and the coalition’s presence is no longer needed.The resolution adopted Friday to close the UNAMI mission expresses support for Iraq’s reform efforts aimed at fighting corruption, respecting and protecting human rights, delivering essential services to its people, creating jobs and diversifying the economy.It asks the secretary-general to streamline UNAMI’s tasks ahead of the mission’s closure to focus on providing advice, support and technical assistance to the government to strengthen preparations for free elections, including for the federal Parliament and for the Parliament in the Kurdistan region.It also authorizes UNAMI to facilitate progress toward finally resolving outstanding issues between Iraq and Kuwait, stemming from Saddam Hussein’s invasion of its smaller neighbor in August 1990.In addition, the resolution says UNAMI should help with the return of internally displaced Iraqis and those in Syria, with providing health care and other services and with economic development. And it also authorizes the mission to \"promote accountability and the protection of human rights, and judicial and legal reform.\"U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood welcomed the resolution’s unanimous adoption and plans for an orderly wind down of UNAMI.\"We all recognize that Iraq has changed dramatically in recent years and UNAMI’s mission needed to be realigned as part of our commitment to fostering a secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" he told the council.Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador Anna Evstigneeva stressed that what was important for Moscow in voting for the resolution was that the United States took into account the priorities Iraq wanted UNAMI to focus on in its final months.\"We are convinced that in the 20 years since its establishment UNAMI has fully realized its potential to assist in the restoration of Iraqi statehood and that the people of Iraq are now ready to assume full responsibility for the country’s political future,\" she said. \"We express our firm support for Iraq sovereignty and oppose any interference in the country’s internal affairs. That is an imperative.\"'}\n",

Conducted by the agency\\'s Economist Impact Unit, the study comes as Pakistan is experiencing an intense heatwave that has sickened thousands of people, further burdening the country\\'s health care system.28 CONFIRMED DEAD IN PAKISTAN AFTER BUS PLUNGES INTO ROCKY RAVINETemperatures in various parts of Pakistan soared as high as 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) Friday.Authorities were also battling forest fires, which Pakistan has been experiencing during heatwaves in recent years. Near the capital, Islamabad, a fire broke out on Thursday but officials have yet to determine whether it was caused by the high temperatures.Plumes of smoke were seen rising from the hills around Islamabad as firefighting helicopters flew overhead to douse the flames.Amid soaring temperatures, authorities urged people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.\"Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,\" said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.\"Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,\" Fadil said. \"We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough.

The interior minister said it was the first such thwarted plot targeting the Games, which start in eight weeks as France is on its highest threat alert level.The man is accused of planning a ‘’violent action’’ on behalf of the Islamic State group’s jihadist ideology, the national counterterrorism prosecutor’s office said in a statement Friday. The man, who was not identified, is behind held in custody pending further investigation.AI-DRIVEN RISK INTELLIGENCE FIRM WORKS TO COMBAT DISINFORMATION AS CYBERSECURITY COMES INTO FOCUS FOR OLYMPICSInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement that members of the General Directorate of Internal Security arrested an 18-year-old man from Chechnya on May 22 on suspicion of being behind a plan to attack soccer events that will be held in the southern city of Saint-Etienne.According to the initial investigation, the man was preparing an attack targeting the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne that will host several soccer matches during the Summer Games. The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events \"to die and become a martyr,\" the statement also said.France is on in its highest security alert ahead of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which are expected to draw millions of visitors, and run July 26-Aug. 11. Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris’ Stade de France.Darmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but has said there are multiple potential threats, including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries.The Paris Olympics organizing committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services. ‘’Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders — and will continue to be fully mobilized,\\'\\' it said in a statement.Security concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony, which brings more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments.In April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country’s national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high.Organizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000.The French government also decided that tourists won’t be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead.Extra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily.'}\n",

At least seven other suspects were also detained.The Block of Popular Resistance and Rebellion — known as the BPR for its initials in Spanish — issued a statement saying Melara’s arrest \"is arbitrary and is an act of political persecution.\"The group demanded his release, and said \"we do not recognize the unconstitutional and illegitimate president who will take office on June 1.\" It said it would \"start an new stage of struggle in the face of Bukele’s imposition as president.\"In February, the highly popular Bukele easily won a second term in his country’s presidential elections, despite the country’s constitution prohibiting reelection.He has sparked criticism for his anti-gang raids and mass arrests, but the supposed bomb plot may have involved the terms of the 1992 peace accords that ended the civil war and guaranteed former rebels a place in politics.Bukele has made some moves that critics say endanger the Central American nation’s fragile democracy, which was restored after the brutal civil war.In addition to going after critics and locking up 1% of his country’s population in his gang crackdown, the leader last year also approved reforms slashing the number of seats in Congress, effectively weighting upcoming elections in his party’s favor.While it has involved allegations of abuse and unjust imprisonment, the gang crackdown has made Bukele popular; the country’s street gangs once essentially ruled many neighborhoods with brutality, killing and extorting money from almost everyone.Bukele not only won reelection. His party also won a super majority in Congress, effectively allowing him to rule with few checks on his power.'}\n",

And that includes also attacking military legitimate targets inside Russia.\"\"If you look at the battlefield now, Russia is launching attacks on Ukraine’s soil from Russian soil with artillery, missiles, and massing troops,\" he said. \"And, of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks.\"Ukrainian officials had stepped up calls on the U.S. administration to allow their forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, is just 12 miles from the Russian border.Ukrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.Russia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and Western Europe’s inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.The alliance is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and leaders will be meeting in Washington in July to reaffirm their support. Stoltenberg said he expects to be able to announce at the summit that at least two-thirds of members are meeting their commitment to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.'}\n",

Often overlooked, their contributions have come into sharper focus as the number of living D-Day veterans dwindles and the world prepares for the 80th anniversary of the landings.One of those women was Marie Scott, who was a 17-year-old radio operator when she heard the chaos of battle through her headset as she relayed messages between Allied commanders in England and men on the Normandy beaches.\"You realize the reality of war, what it really entails. It’s not a word. It’s an action that affects thousands, millions,\" Scott said recently, discussing her time in the Women’s Royal Naval Service, commonly known as the Wrens. \"I think I grew up that day from being a stupid 17-year-old. I think I honestly grew up on D-Day.\"Almost 160,000 Allied troops landed at Normandy on D-Day in a massive amphibious operation designed to break through heavily fortified German defenses and begin the liberation of Western Europe.Throughout the war, more than 1.1 million women served in the armed forces of the Western Allies, including 640,000 in Britain, where there was a real threat of invasion after Nazi troops drove to the shores of the English Channel.Even Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, did her bit, training to be a driver and mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the women’s branch of the British Army.The pitch on recruiting posters was simple: By joining the military and taking over support roles, women could free men for front-line service. Although technically barred from combat, more than 800 British women were killed in military service during the war.\"People forget they were 17, 18 doing these jobs,\" said Dick Goodwin, the honorary secretary of the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, which helps veterans travel to Normandy each year. \"I mean, it’s just amazing, really. Talk about thrown in at the deep end!\"Those who did not join the military had other opportunities to serve. Millions of women worked in defense factories, grew crops and rode motorcycles through the blacked out streets of London to keep firefighters updated on the latest bomb damage as the British government asked them to keep the economy going after men went off to fight.The Allied nations’ decision to mobilize women was an important strategic choice that contrasted with Nazi Germany, where the authorities relied on forced labor, according to Ian Johnson, a historian at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana.\"Part of the intent was to take it — use the economic and material advantages of the Allies and really … put that to greatest use compared to the way the Germans structured their military,\" he said. \"So those support roles were crucial in providing the logistical advantages that help the Allies win.\"Altogether, some 7 million British women served their country in some capacity during World War II.Their sacrifices are honored with a sculpture in central London, near the Cenotaph, the national war memorial.The bronze monolith is decorated with 17 different uniforms hung on pegs to represent the jobs women took on during the war, then gave up when the men returned.They include the uniforms of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and the Women’s Royal Naval Service. But there are also police overalls, a nursing cape and a welder’s mask.\"I get a certain satisfaction from my wartime experience,\" Scott said. \"And I do allow myself, occasionally, just a tinge of pride in my younger self.\"'}\n",

Wade was overturned in 2022.In a unanimous ruling, the court upheld the Texas law after the women filed a lawsuit in March 2023 seeking clarity on when exceptions to the abortion ban are permitted, arguing the law was confusing for doctors who might turn away patients over fears of repercussions.The same issue was at the center of a separate lawsuit brought last year by Dallas mother Kate Cox, who sought court permission to obtain an abortion after her fetus developed a fatal condition during a pregnancy that resulted in multiple trips to an emergency room. She eventually left the state to have the procedure.MAN FINED FOR STANDING SILENTLY OUTSIDE UK ABORTION CLINIC, OFFICERS COULDN\\'T TELL HIM HIS CRIMEThe court said Friday that the law\\'s exceptions are broad enough and that doctors would be misinterpreting the law if they decided not to perform an abortion when the mother\\'s life is in danger.\"Texas law permits a life-saving abortion,\" the court wrote in the order signed by Justice Jane Bland.The decision closed, at least for now, another pathway for opponents who have attempted to force the state to provide more clarity about when exceptions to abortions are allowed. Last year, plaintiffs in the lawsuit testified in court how they carried babies they knew would not survive and continued with pregnancies that put their health at risk.Plaintiff Kaitlyn Kash, whose fetus developed severe skeletal dysplasia, was told even the simplest movements could break its bones in utero. Her life was not threatened, but she still chose to leave Texas for an abortion.\"I wanted to end my child’s pain before it could begin,\" Kash said. \"The state just told me that as a mother, I don’t have the right to make those decisions for my child. ... If you want to grow your family, if you want to have children, you should get out of Texas.\"The Texas law states that doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison, fines of up to $100,000 and could lose their state medical licenses.\"Now we know the courthouse doors are closed to them,\" said Molly Duane, a staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented the group of Texas women. \"It seems Texans have nowhere to go but the voting booth, in terms of what comes next.\"Last year, a lower court granted a temporary injunction preventing Texas from enforcing the ban against doctors who performed an abortion using their \"good faith judgment\" after determining a pregnancy was unsafe due to medical complications. That ruling, however, was immediately blocked after an appeal from the Texas attorney general\\'s office to the state’s Supreme Court.The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, Amanda Zurawski, had been told that she had a condition that her baby would not survive. She said she was forced to wait until she was diagnosed with a life-threatening case of sepsis before obtaining an abortion. She spent three days in intensive care and was left with a permanently closed fallopian tube from an infection, affecting her ability to have more children.The court ruled Friday that state law does not require that a woman\\'s death or serious impairment be \"imminent\" when she is evaluated by a doctor for a potential abortion.\"Ms. Zurawski\\'s agonizing wait to be ill \\'enough\\' for induction, her development of sepsis, and her permanent physical injury are not the results the law commands,\" the court wrote.Zurawski said the ruling was \"heartbreaking.\"\"I am outraged on behalf of my fellow plaintiffs who the Court deemed not sick enough,\" Zurawski said. \"We all deserve bodily autonomy. Every day, people in Texas are being told that they have no options. It’s sickening and wrong.\"Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton praised the ruling after his office defended the law in this case.LOUISIANA CLASSIFIES ABORTION DRUGS AS CONTROLLED, DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES AFTER GOV. LANDRY GREENLIGHTS PROPOSAL\"I will continue to defend the laws enacted by the Legislature and uphold the values of the people of Texas by doing everything in my power to protect mothers and babies,\" Paxton posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.The lawsuit argued that exemptions under the Texas law, which allow an abortion to save a mother\\'s life or prevent the impairment of a major bodily function, led to confusion among doctors, who were turning away some pregnant women experiencing health complications because they feared repercussions.The plaintiffs said the abortion ban, which allows an abortion to save a mother\\'s life or prevent the impairment of a major bodily function, has made doctors fear of potential liability if the state does not consider a case a medical emergency.New guidelines proposed by the state medical board earlier this year did not provide much beyond advising doctors to meticulously document their decision-making.

The state Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s dismissal of that lawsuit, but the majority rejected arguments from voting rights groups that the measure violates state constitutional voting rights.KANSAS GOV. KELLY TO CALL SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION OVER TAX CUTSIn fact, Justice Caleb Stegall, writing for the majority, said that the dissenting justices wrongly accused the majority of ignoring past precedent, holding that the court has not identified a \"fundamental right to vote\" within the state constitution.\"It simply is not there,\" Stegall wrote.Justice Eric Rosen, one of the three who dissented, shot back: \"It staggers my imagination to conclude Kansas citizens have no fundamental right to vote under their state constitution.\"\"I cannot and will not condone this betrayal of our constitutional duty to safeguard the foundational rights of Kansans,\" Rosen added.Conversely, the high court unanimously sided with the challengers of a different provision that makes it a crime for someone to give the appearance of being an election official. Voting rights groups, including Kansas League of Women Voters and the nonprofit Loud Light, argued the measure suppresses free speech and their ability to register voters as some might wrongly assume volunteers are election workers, putting them at risk of criminal prosecution.A Shawnee County District Court judge had earlier rejected the groups\\' request for an emergency injunction, saying that impersonation of a public official is not protected speech.But the high court faulted the new law, noting that it doesn\\'t include any requirement that prosecutors show intent by a voter registration volunteer to misrepresent or deceive people into believing they\\'re an election official, and it thus \"criminalizes honest speech\" where \"occasional misunderstandings\" are bound to occur, Stegall wrote in the majority opinion.\"As such, it sweeps up protected speech in its net,\" Stegall said.Because the lawsuit over the false impersonation law\\'s constitutionality is likely to succeed, the state Supreme Court ordered the lower court to reconsider issuing an emergency injunction against it.\"For three years now, Kansas League of Women Voters volunteers have been forced to severely limit their assistance of voters due to this ambiguous and threatening law,\" said Martha Pint, president of the chapter. \"The League’s critical voter assistance work is not a crime, and we are confident this provision will be quickly blocked when the case returns to the district court.\"Loud Light executive director Davis Hammet said he hopes the lower court \"will stop the irreparable harm caused daily by the law and allow us to resume voter registration before the general election.\"Neither Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab nor state Attorney General Kris Kobach responded to requests for comment on that portion of the high court\\'s ruling.Instead, in a joint statement, Schwab and Kobach focus on the high court\\'s language bolstering the signature verification law and its upholding of a provision that says individuals may collect no more than 10 advance ballots to submit to election officials.\"This ruling allows us to preserve reasonable election security laws in Kansas,\" Schwab said.Supporters have argued the ballot collection restriction combats \"ballot harvesting\" and limits voter fraud. The GOP-led Legislature passed it over a veto by Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. Critics have said it\\'s a Republican reaction to baseless claims that the 2020 election was not valid, which prompted a wave of misinformation and voter suppression laws across the country.Last year, the Kansas Court of Appeals reinstated a lawsuit challenging the ballot collection limitation and the signature verification, saying both impair the right to vote. But the high court upheld the limit on ballot collections, saying \"voters have numerous avenues available to deliver their ballots\" and that ballot collecting doesn\\'t fall within the parameters of free speech.Kobach defended the majority\\'s opinion as \"well-reasoned\" and confirms that the Legislature has the constitutional authority to establish proofs \"to ensure voters are who they say they are.\"\"And that is exactly what Kansas’s signature verification requirement is,\" Kobach said.'}\n",

Meet 20th century socialist firebrand Eugene Debs\", 'description': \"If former President Trump is sentenced to prison time, he won't be the first major presidential candidate to run from behind bars — Eugene Debs did it over a century ago.\", 'content': 'Following his unprecedented felony conviction, former president and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has to wait to find out what his sentence will be. But even if it involves time behind bars, that doesn\\'t mean his campaign to return to the White House comes to an end.He wouldn\\'t even be the first candidate to run for that office while imprisoned. That piece of history belongs to Eugene V. Debs, who ran on the Socialist Party ticket in 1920 — and garnered almost a million votes, or about 3 percent.AMERICANS MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD ON THE TRUMP VERDICTThe circumstances are obviously different. Debs, despite his influence and fame, was effectively a fringe candidate that year; Trump has already held the office and is running as the near-certain nominee of one of the country\\'s two major political parties. But there are similarities, too.Debs, born in 1855, became a strong voice advocating for labor causes from the time he was a young man. A staunch union member and leader, he was first sent to prison for six months following the 1894 Pullman rail strike, on grounds he violated a federal injunction against the strike.He became a committed socialist, and a founding member of the Socialist Party of America. He ran for president as a socialist in 1900, 1904, 1908 and 1912.In 1918, though, he was sent to prison for speaking out against American involvement in World War I, which was a violation of the recently passed Sedition Act. But being locked up in a federal prison in Atlanta didn\\'t lower Debs\\' profile at all, and in 1920, he was once again nominated as the party\\'s presidential candidate.Being in prison didn\\'t make campaigning impossible, either. While Debs obviously could not travel around the country himself, his party turned his status into a rallying point, using his convict number on campaign buttons. Surrogates spoke for him, as well as a film clip of him being told of his nomination that played around the country, said Thomas Doherty, professor of American Studies at Brandeis University.\"The fame of Debs and the novelty of him running for president from prison gave him a sort of purchase,\" Doherty said. \"It was a credible campaign, considering you\\'re running from prison.\"'}\n",

They also said the most important aspect of the galaxy was how luminous the galaxy was from such a far distance.The galaxy is estimated to be more than 1,600 light years across, and the light is suspected to be coming from young stars and not emission from a growing supermassive black hole.WITNESS THE MESMERIZING CONJUNCTION OF THE MOON AND VENUS IN SPACEThe starlight also implies the galaxy is several hundreds of millions of times the mass of the Sun, the astronomers claim, leading to more mysteries of how it can make such a bright and massive galaxy in less than 300 million years.The astronomers learned through the data that the color of the galaxy was reddened by dust and was not as blue as it could be in early phases of the galaxy.Wavelengths of light collected by Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) indicated the brightness of the source was above what would be extrapolated from the measurements of other instruments on the telescope, suggesting the presence of ionized gas emission from hydrogen and oxygen.They say oxygen being present at such an early stage suggests multiple generations of massive stars already lived their lives before the telescope was able to observe the galaxy, the astronomers said.\"All of these observations, together, tell us that JADES-GS-z14-0 is not like the types of galaxies that have been predicted by theoretical models and computer simulations to exist in the very early universe,\" the astronomers said in the press release. \"Given the observed brightness of the source, we can forecast how it might grow over cosmic time, and so far, we have not found any suitable analogs from the hundreds of other galaxies we’ve observed at high redshift in our survey.\\xa0\"It is likely that astronomers will find many such luminous galaxies, possibly at even earlier times, over the next decade with Webb,\" the team added. \"We’re thrilled to see the extraordinary diversity of galaxies that existed at Cosmic Dawn!\"The findings are still being studied and have not been through the peer-review process, according to NASA.The Webb Telescope, the successor to the Hubble and the largest telescope ever launched into space, is a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency.\\xa0'}\n",

A handful of planets are usually in the night sky at any given time, though they can be obscured below the horizon or blocked out by the sun’s light.Unfortunately, this planetary parade of Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune won’t offer much of a view.\"The sun’s going to be photobombing the parade,\" said Ronald Gamble, a theoretical astrophysicist at NASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center.Mercury and Jupiter will be too close to the horizon to be visible, blotted out by the rising sun. Uranus and Neptune can be glimpsed only with a telescope, though Uranus may be too close to the sun to be visible.Early risers can still look to the east to spot a waning crescent moon on the lower left, followed by a faintly red Mars and pale yellow dot of Saturn. Both planets are already visible in the early mornings and will be for much of the summer.While June’s planetary parade may not dazzle, the night sky still offers wonders to spot.The summer offers great weather to explore the night sky with a star or planet-viewing app, said Michelle Nichols at Chicago’s Adler Planetarium.And the annual Perseid meteor shower is expected to peak in mid-August with quick streaks of light. Nichols recommends observing the shower away from city lights and allowing your eyes to adjust to the dark for prime viewing.'}\n",

As the parrots soar squawking past their home, the couple can readily identify bird No. 17 by its smooth feathers and can tell No. 16 from No. 22, which has two beads attached to its radio collar.This familiarity offers a glimpse of the South African couple’s commitment to saving one of the world\\'s most critically endangered species. The parrot — endemic to a small fraction of the Sao Francisco River basin and already rare in the 19th century — was declared extinct in the wild in 2000, when a lonely surviving male disappeared following decades of poaching and habitat destruction from livestock overgrazing. The few remaining birds were scattered in private collections around the world.For the Spix\\'s macaws, immortalized in the popular animated \"Rio\" films, the road back from the edge of extinction has been a long, winding and bumpy one.SCIENTISTS SAY ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS AS ESSENTIAL AS EVER AFTER 50 YEARS OF SUCCESSThreats that had devastated the Spix’s macaws still loom, and the birds now face another menace: climate change. The species’ original territory overlaps what has recently been officially designated Brazil’s first arid climate region.The drier conditions worry Cromwell Purchase because of their potential impact on habitat for the few surviving Spix’s macaws.\"A dry area only gets rain for a very short period of the year. A drought in that period might go an entire year before you’re going to get your next rain,\" said Purchase, a tall and slim 46-year-old. \"The animals are adapted to harsh environments, but they are on the edge. Any small increment of change will decimate populations.\"In November, two federal research institutes released a study of rainfall water loss in plants and soil between 1960 and 2020. It showed that northern Bahia state, including Curaca, where the Spix’s macaws are trying to survive, is now consistent with a desert area. It also identified the expansion of semi-arid climate in the Northeast, where nearly 55 million people live.LESSER-KNOWN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE US THREATENED BY FUNDING DISPARITIES\"If the planet is warmer, there will be much greater evaporation. So, the water leaves the environment and generates aridity,\" the director of Brazil’s anti-desertification efforts, Alexandre Pires, told The Associated Press.Since 2005, semi-arid area in Brazil has expanded by 116,000 square miles and is now roughly the size of three Californias. The government is set to announce measures to avoid desertification by promoting better management of soil and other natural resources in the region.In the face of the changing climate and numerous challenges, at every turn the Purchases have dedicated the better part of their adult lives to breeding Spix\\'s macaws and reintroducing them into nature. The journey first took the biologists to work with a private collection on an oasis in Qatar. When the birds were sold to a nonprofit organization, the couple moved with them to Germany.Over the past four years, their efforts have been centered in the rural area of Curaca, a nondescript town of 34,000 people.Under an agreement between the Brazilian government and the German nonprofit Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, 52 Spix’s macaws were sent in 2020 to Brazil on two charter flights. Federal police escorted them to breeding and reintroduction facilities accessible by a 1-hour drive on a rough dirt road, where the Purchases live and work for the nonprofit.The following year, 20 Spix’s macaws were released in the wild, along with 15 wild-sourced Blue-Winged macaws, whose purpose was to \"teach\" them how to fly, avoid risks and forage. Last year, two Spix’s macaw chicks were born in freedom — the first ones in decades— but they didn\\'t survive.All released birds were equipped with radio collars designed to resist macaws’ strong bills. Each collar has an antenna. The Purchases and their assistant check the birds\\' locations three times a day.Half of the Spix’s macaws have died, mostly from predation, or disappeared. Now, the remaining ones live within 3 miles of the facilities, a compound that includes the couple’s house and a U-shaped flight-and-release cage that\\'s 51 yards long.In March, three more of the light pale blue chicks were born in the wild. Not only did they survive, but one of them also flew for the first time last week, a major breakthrough.\"This event is so important as it shows how comfortable the parents are in their wild environment,\" Candice Purchase said in a text message. \"A remarkable achievement for the birds and an incredible success for the release.\"US GOVERNMENT DECLARES RARE LIZARD ENDANGERED, SPARKING CLASH BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND OIL INDUSTRYTo mitigate the impacts of desertification, the German parrot nonprofit partnered with a private company, Blue Sky Caatinga, to promote reforestation of 59,300 acres in the territory of Spix’s macaw. This initiative involves engaging small farmers who heavily depend on goat raising.Unlike depictions in the animated films \"Rio\" and \"Rio 2,\" which brought attention to the Spix’s macaw extinction threat, the parrot’s natural habitat is far from Brazil’s most famous city, Rio de Janeiro, and the Amazon rainforest. It lives among the sparse, thorny, low caatinga vegetation that often loses greenery during dry periods. And the bird uses the Caraibeira, a towering evergreen tree that grows near small intermittent creeks, for nesting and food. During breeding season, the trees allow the pairs to conserve energy and avoid flying long distances to feed.When the macaws first arrived from Germany, they were offered various foods from the wild. \"We found that it took a while for the birds to recognize them as food,\" Purchase said. \"But the Caraibeira tree produces a seed pod, almost like helicopter seeds. The Spix’s had never seen anything like it before. We put those in the cages and some picked them up and immediately knew how to open them and eat the kernel inside, which was totally remarkable and took us by surprise.\"The project also faces challenges outside the natural world. On May 15, the federal government informed the nonprofit that it would terminate the agreement, which expires on June 5. In a statement to the AP, Brazil\\'s federal environmental agency said it discovered that, in 2023, the nonprofit transferred Spix’s macaws from its center in Germany to other countries without its consent. The agreement will not be renewed until the situation is clarified, but the government said the nonprofit can continue its reintroduction work. The project\\'s funding comes from international donors.The strained relations have put a pause on plans to release 20 parrots per year over 20 years. \"No release in 2023 and now looking like a 2024 release is unlikely. It would be a shame for the project to fail because of government politics,\" Purchase said.There are approximately 360 Spix’s macaws in captivity worldwide, with 46 in Curaca.Despite the hurdles, many residents of Curaca, even if they never have never seen a Spix\\'s macaw, expect them to soon return to flying over the region and not just be seen in countless paintings that made the parrot part of the city\\'s identity.\"The project is already a success. They are free,\" said Maria de Lourdes Oliveira, whose family leased part of their land for reforestation. \"The most difficult thing was to arrive in Brazil. I cried when I saw them going to freedom and flapping their wings.\"'}\n",

But only recently have they been able to kill the trees. Scientists say they recently discovered about 40 sequoia trees that have died from beetle infestations, mostly within the national parks.\"We’re documenting some trees that are actually dying from kind of a combination of drought and fire that have weakened them to a point where they’re not able to defend themselves from the beetle attack,\" Ambrose said.The beetles attack the trees from the canopy, boring into branches and working their way down the trunk. If left unchecked, the tiny beetles can kill a tree within six months.That’s why park officials allowed Ambrose and his colleagues to climb General Sherman. They conducted the tree health inspection as journalists and visitors watched them pull themselves up ropes dangling from the canopy. They examined the branches and trunk, looking for the tiny holes that indicate beetle activity.But it’s not possible to climb every sequoia tree to directly inspect the canopy in person. That’s why they’re also testing whether drones equipped with sensors and aided by satellite imagery can be used to monitor and detect beetle infestations on a larger scale within the forests.Tuesday’s health inspection of General Sherman was organized by the Giant Sequoia Lands Coalition, a group of government agencies, Native tribes and environmental groups. They hope to establish a health monitoring program for the towering trees.If they discover beetle infestations, officials say, they could try to combat the attacks by spraying water, removing branches or using chemical treatments.Bark beetles have ravaged pine and fir forests throughout the Western United States in recent years, but they previously didn’t pose a threat to giant sequoias, which can live 3,000 years.\"They have really withstood insect attacks for a lot of years. So why now? Why are we seeing this change?\" said Clay Jordan, superintendent for Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. \"There’s a lot that we need to learn in order to ensure good stewardship of these trees for a long time.\"'}\n",

Previous calculations put the roots of this process more than 130,000 miles below, an international team reported Wednesday.The sun’s intense magnetic energy is the source of solar flares and eruptions of plasma known as coronal mass ejections. When directed toward Earth, they can create stunning auroras but also disrupt power and communications.EARTH IN THE CLEAR AFTER SUN EMITS LARGEST SOLAR FLARE IN NEARLY 10-YEAR CYCLE\"We still don’t understand the sun well enough to make accurate predictions\" of space weather, lead author Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh said in an email.The latest findings published in the journal Nature \"will be an important step toward finally resolving\" this mysterious process known as solar dynamo, added co-author Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University.Galileo was among the first astronomers to turn a telescope skyward and study sunspots, back in the early 1600s. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur near sunspots, dark patches as big as Earth that are located near the most intense portions of the sun’s shifting magnetic field.Vasil and his team developed new models of the interaction between the sun’s magnetic field and the flow of plasma, which varies at different latitudes during an 11-year cycle. They fed their calculations into a NASA supercomputer in Northern California — the same one used in the 2015 movie \"The Martian\" to verify the best flight path to rescue the main character. The results suggested a shallow magnetic field and additional research is needed to confirm this.The modeling was \"highly simplified,\" University of Wisconsin-Madison\\'s Ellen Zweibel, who was not part of the team, said in an accompanying editorial.The results are intriguing and \"sure to inspire future studies,\" Zweibel said.The new knowledge should improve long-term solar forecasts, allowing scientists to better predict the strength of our star\\'s future cycles. The sun is approaching its peak level of activity in the current 11-year cycle, thus the recent flareups.Strong solar flares and outbursts of billions of tons of plasma earlier this month unleashed severe solar storms that produced auroras in unexpected places. Last week, the sun spewed out the biggest solar flare in almost 20 years, but it steered clear of Earth.Better understanding of the sun can ensure \"we are prepared for when the next storm — potentially much more dangerous — hits Earth,\" Lecoanet said.'}\n",

Now, it has colorful competition.There’s a growing buzz around pink noise, brown noise, green noise — a rainbow of soothing sounds — and their theoretical effects on sleep, concentration and relaxation response.The science is new with only a few small studies behind it, but that hasn’t stopped thousands of people from listening to hours of these noises on YouTube and on meditation apps that provide a palette of color noises with paid subscriptions.IMPROVING MEMORY MAY BE AS EASY AS POPPING A MULTIVITAMIN, STUDY FINDS: ‘PREVENTS VASCULAR DEMENTIA\\'To understand pink noise, start with white, the most familiar of the color noises.White noise is similar to static on a radio or TV. Sound engineers define it as having equal volume across all the frequencies audible to the human ear. It gets its name from white light, which contains all the visible color wavelengths.But the high frequencies of white noise can sound harsh. Pink noise turns down the volume on those higher frequencies, so it sounds lower in pitch and more like the natural sound of rain or the ocean.Brown noise sounds even lower in pitch, giving it a pleasing, soothing rumble.Pink and brown, like white, have standard definitions to audio experts. Other color noises are more recent creations with very flexible definitions.White noise and pink noise may provide small benefits for people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, according to a recent review of limited ADHD studies. In theory, it wakes up the brain, said ADHD researcher and co-author Joel Nigg of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.\"The noise provides stimulation to the brain without providing information, and so it doesn’t distract,\" Nigg said.White noise has been used to treat ringing or buzzing in the ear, called tinnitus.Scientists at Northwestern University are studying how short pulses of pink noise can enhance the slow brain waves of deep sleep. In small studies, these pink-noise pulses have shown promise in improving memory and the relaxation response.Pink noise has a frequency profile \"very similar to the distribution of brain wave frequencies we see in slow-wave sleep because these are large, slow waves,\" said Dr. Roneil Malkani, assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.If Northwestern’s research pans out, it could lead to a medical device to improve sleep or memory through personalized pulses of pink noise. But many scientific questions remain unanswered, Malkani said. \"There’s still a lot of work we have to do.\"If color noises feel calming and help you drown out distractions, it makes sense to use them. Keep them at a quiet level, of course, to prevent hearing loss and take \"plenty of breaks for the ears to rest,\" Nigg said.'}\n",

Cold-blooded animals, including reptiles like snakes and lizards, depend on outside sources to control their temperature: For example, basking in the sun to warm up.NEW MEXICO STUDY SHOWS NEWLY DISCOVERED DINOSAUR SUBSPECIES PREDATES TYRANNOSAURUS REXKnowing when dinosaurs evolved their stable internal thermometer could help scientists answer other questions about how they lived, including how active and social they were.To estimate the origin of the first warm-blooded dinosaurs, researchers analyzed over 1,000 fossils, climate models and dinosaurs’ family trees. They found that two major groups of dinosaurs — which include Tyrannosaurus rex, velociraptors and relatives of triceratops — migrated to chillier areas during the Early Jurassic period, indicating they may have developed the ability to stay warm. A third crop of dinosaurs, which includes brontosaurs, stuck to warmer areas.\"If something is capable of living in the Arctic, or very cold regions, it must have some way of heating up,\" said Alfio Allesandro Chiarenza, a study author and a postdoctoral fellow at University College London.The research was published Wednesday in the journal Current Biology.Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral fellow at the Field Museum in Chicago, said a dinosaur’s location is not the only way to determine whether it is warm-blooded. Research by Wiemann, who was not involved with the latest study, suggests that warm-blooded dinosaurs may have evolved closer to the beginning of their time on Earth, around 250 million years ago.She said compiling clues from multiple aspects of dinosaurs’ lives — including their body temperatures and diets — may help scientists paint a clearer picture of when they evolved to be warm-blooded.'}\n",

They are also a\\xa0valuable food source for birds and mammals.\\xa0According to one social media video, turkeys have been feasting on cicadas.

They\\'re insects, so they have to shed their skin to get to the next stage, and they will go through their final molt where they pull out of their immature skin, and they will be in their adult skin, which will have wings,\" Benson said.\\xa0\"They’ll molt, expand their wings, harden up and when they\\'re ready they’ll fly up into the trees.\"He said that eventually the cicadas will mate in a noisy fashion and then the females will deposit their eggs onto tree branches. They will hatch and fall into the ground where they will stay for the next 13 or 17 years before the process repeats.\\xa0So many cicadas will make noise at once in some places that sound levels might reach upward of 90 to 120 decibels, equivalent to a gas-powered lawnmower or motorcycle, the U.S. Forest Service says.\\xa0Meanwhile, the mating cicadas will die off and homeowners will be left hoping that the dead carcasses do not land in their gardens as they can smell badly if they die in large numbers together.Females\\xa0laying their eggs on small tree branches can harm young trees and the EPA advises covering maturing saplings in mesh or netting to keep the insects out.Experts also advise homeowners to cover pools, patio furniture or similar items from cicada or their droppings when they are active.Brood XIII cicadas appear on a 17-year cycle, and are restricted mostly to northern Illinois, eastern Iowa, southern Wisconsin and a few counties in extreme northwestern Indiana, according to entomologist Floyd Shockley of the Smithsonian Institution\\'s National Museum of Natural History in Washington.\\xa0Brood XIX emerges on a slightly shorter 13-year cycle, and are widely distributed from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia - a total of 15 states, according to Shockley.

The exact amounts are unclear. Earth’s atmosphere is a blend of nitrogen, oxygen, argon and other gases.\"It’s probably the firmest evidence yet that this planet has an atmosphere,\" said Ian Crossfield, an astronomer at the University of Kansas who studies exoplanets and was not involved with the research.ASTRONOMERS DISCOVER SOLAR SYSTEM WITH 6 PLANETS IN PERFECT SYNCThe research was published in the journal Nature.Super Earth refers to a planet’s size — bigger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. The boiling temperatures on this planet — which can reach as hot as 4,200 degrees Fahrenheit – mean that it is unlikely to host life.Instead, scientists say the discovery is a promising sign that other such rocky planets with thick atmospheres could exist that may be more hospitable.The exoplanet 41 light years away is eight times heavier than Earth and circles its star Copernicus so closely that it has permanent day and night sides. A light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles. Its surface is encrusted with magma oceans.To identify the makeup of its atmosphere, researchers studied Webb Space Telescope observations before and after the planet passed behind its star.They separated the light emitted from the planet versus its star and used the data to calculate the planet\\'s temperature.

            "{'title': 'Basic building blocks of sperm whale language have been uncovered, scientists say', 'description': 'Scientists studying sperm whales have identified the basic elements of their communication system, potentially paving the way for better protection of the mammals.', 'content': 'Scientists studying the sperm whales that live around the Caribbean island of Dominica have described for the first time the basic elements of how they might be talking to each other, in an effort that could one day help better protect them.Like many whales and dolphins, sperm whales are highly social mammals and communicate by squeezing air through their respiratory systems to make strings of rapid clicks that can sound like an extremely loud zipper underwater. The clicks are also used as a form of echolocation to help them track their prey.Scientists have been trying for decades to understand what those clicks might mean, with only minimal progress. While they still don\\'t know, they now think there are sets of clicks they believe make up a \"phonetic alphabet\" that the whales can use to build the very rough equivalent of what people think of as words and phrases.REAL LIFE DR. DOLITTLE? SCIENTISTS ON VERGE OF CRACKING CODE FOR TALKING TO ANIMALS\"We\\'re now starting to find the first building blocks of whale language,\" said David Gruber, founder and president of the Cetacean Translation Initiative or CETI, an effort devoted to translating the communication of sperm whales.In a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, researchers analyzed more than 8,700 snippets of sperm whale clicks, known as codas. They say they have found four basic components they think make up this phonetic alphabet.Pratyusha Sharma, the paper\\'s lead researcher, said this alphabet could then be used by the whales in an unlimited number of combinations.\"It doesn’t appear that they have a fixed set of codas,\" said Sharma, an artificial intelligence and computer science expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"That gives the whales access to a much larger communication system,\" she said, explaining it was as if the whales had a very large dictionary.Sperm whales have the biggest brains of any animal on the planet at up to 20 pounds, as much as six times the size of an average human brain. Thy live in matriarchal groups of about 10 and sometimes meet up with hundreds or thousands of other whales. Sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet long and dive to nearly 3,280 feet to hunt for squid. They sleep vertically, in groups.Gruber, a biology professor at the City University of New York, said sperm whales seem to have sophisticated social ties and deciphering their communication systems could reveal parallels with human language and society.To get enough examples of the sperm whale clicks in Dominica, where there is a resident population of about 200 whales, scientists created a giant underwater recording studio with microphones at different depths. Tags on the whales also record what position they are in when clicking — for example diving, sleeping, breathing at the surface — and if there are any other whales nearby they might be communicating with.Jeremy Goldbogen, an associate professor of oceans at Stanford University, called the new research \"extraordinary,\" saying it had \"vast implications for how we understand ocean giants.\"Goldbogen, who was not involved in the study, said that if we were one day able to understand what sperm whales were saying, that knowledge should be used for conservation purposes, like minimizing their risk of being hit by ships or reducing ocean noise levels.Sperm whales are classified as \" vulnerable \" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The whales were hunted for centuries for the oil contained in their giant heads and the species is still recovering.Diana Reiss, a marine mammal behavior and communication expert at the City University of New York, said that scientists understand certain aspects of marine animals\\' communication reasonably well, including the whistles used by dolphins and the songs sung by humpback whales.But when it comes to sperm whales, even that basic knowledge is lacking.\"What\\'s new in this study is that they are trying to look at the basis for the whales\\' communication system ... not just particular calls they\\'re making,\" she said.Reiss, who was not involved in the new research, said she hoped we would one day be able to match the whales’ clicks to behavior.\"We will never understand what the clicks mean to another whale, but we may be able to understand what the clicks mean enough to predict their behavior,\" she said. \"That alone would be an amazing achievement,\" she said.CETI founder Gruber said millions and possibly billions of whale codas would be needed to collect enough data to try to work out what the whales are saying, but he expects AI to help speed the analysis. He said other sperm whale populations — the whales are found in deep oceans from the Arctic to the Antarctic — likely communicate in slightly different ways.'}\n",

This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them — the end of a \"shooting star.\"The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.It’s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.The Southern Hemisphere will have the best view of Eta Aquarids, but a waning moon just 14% full will allow for clear viewing in both hemispheres, according to the American Meteor Society.The meteor society keeps an updated list of upcoming large meteor showers, including the peak viewing days and moonlight conditions.The next big one is the Southern Delta Aquarid meteor shower, which peaks in late July.'}\n",

Three Chinese lunar probe missions are planned over the next four years.JAPAN\\'S MOON LANDER HAS SURVIVED LONGER THAN THE SPACE AGENCY EXPECTED AFTER REACHING 3 MONTHS ON THE MOONFree from exposure to Earth and other interference, the moon’s somewhat mysterious far side is ideal for radio astronomy and other scientific work. Because the far side never faces Earth, a relay satellite is needed to maintain communications.The rocket carrying the Chang’e-6 lunar probe — named after the Chinese mythical moon goddess — lifted off Friday at 5:27 p.m. as planned from the Wenchang launch center on the island province of Hainan. About 35 minutes later it separated entirely from the massive Long March-5 rocket — China\\'s largest — that had slung it into space, as technicians monitoring the launch from ground control smiled and applauded.Shortly afterward, launch mission commander Zhang Zuosheng took to a podium at the front of the room and said the launch had gone off exactly as planned and the spacecraft was on its set trajectory. \"I declare this launch mission a complete success,\" Zhang said to further applause.The Philippine Space Agency issued a statement saying expected debris from the rocket launch was \"projected to have fallen within the identified drop zones.\"China in 2021 was forced to defend its handling of a rocket booster that burned up over the Indian Ocean after the administrator of the American space agency and others accused Beijing of acting recklessly by allowing its rocket to fall to Earth seemingly uncontrolled after the mission.Huge numbers of people crowded Hainan\\'s beaches to view the launch, which comes in the middle of China’s five-day May Day holiday. As with previous recent launches, the event was televised live by state broadcaster CCTV.After orbiting the moon to reduce speed, the lander will separate from the spacecraft and within 48 hours of setting down it will begin drilling into the lunar surface and scooping up samples with its robotic arm. With the samples sealed in a container, it will then reconnect with the returner for the trip back to Earth. The entire mission is set to last 53 days.China in 2020 returned samples from the moon\\'s near side, the first time anyone has done so since the U.S. Apollo program that ended in the 1970s. Analysis of the samples found they contained water in tiny beads embedded in lunar dirt.APRIL’S PINK MOON CAPTURED ON FULL DISPLAY OVER CHESAPEAKE BAYAlso in the past week, three Chinese astronauts returned home from a six-month mission on the country\\'s orbiting space station after the arrival of its replacement crew.China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely because of U.S. concerns over the Chinese military’s total control of the space program amid a sharpening competition in technology between the two geopolitical rivals. U.S. law bars almost all cooperation between the U.S. and Chinese space programs without explicit congressional approval.Faced with such limitations, China has expanded cooperation with other countries and agencies. The latest mission carries scientific instruments from France, Italy and the European Space Agency in cooperation with Sweden. A small Pakistani satellite is also on board.China’s ambitious space program aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2030, as well as bring back samples from Mars around the same year and launch three lunar probe missions over the next four years. The next is scheduled for 2027.Longer-term plans call for a permanent crewed base on the lunar surface, although those appear to remain in the conceptual phase.China conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, becoming the third country after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space using its own resources.The three-module Tiangong, much smaller than the ISS, was launched in 2021 and completed 18 months later. It can accommodate up to six astronauts at a time and is mainly dedicated to scientific research. The crew will also install space debris protection equipment, carry out payload experiments, and beam science classes to students on Earth.China has also said that it eventually plans to offer access to its space station to foreign astronauts and space tourists. With the ISS nearing the end of its useful life, China could eventually be the only country or corporation to maintain a crewed station in orbit.The U.S. space program is believed to still hold a significant edge over China’s due to its spending, supply chains and capabilities.The U.S. aims to put a crew back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025 as part of a renewed commitment to crewed missions, aided by private sector players such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. They plan to land on the moon\\'s south pole where permanently shadowed craters are believed to be packed with frozen water.'}\n",

The orangutan then used his fingers to apply the plant juices to an injury on the right cheek. Afterward, he pressed the chewed plant to cover the open wound like a makeshift bandage, according to a new study in Scientific Reports.Previous research has documented several species of great apes foraging for medicines in forests to heal themselves, but scientists hadn\\'t yet seen an animal treat itself in this way.ZOO JOY: HEARTS MELT WHEN ORANGUTAN \\'ASKS\\' TO SEE BABY THROUGH ENCLOSURE, THEN \\'KISSES\\' GLASS\"This is the first time that we have observed a wild animal applying a quite potent medicinal plant directly to a wound,\" said co-author Isabelle Laumer, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany.The orangutan\\'s intriguing behavior was recorded in 2022 by Ulil Azhari, a co-author and field researcher at the Suaq Project in Medan, Indonesia. Photographs show the animal’s wound closed within a month without any problems.Scientists have been observing orangutans in Indonesia’s Gunung Leuser National Park since 1994, but they hadn’t previously seen this behavior.\"It’s a single observation,\" said Emory University biologist Jacobus de Roode, who was not involved in the study. \"But often we learn about new behaviors by starting with a single observation.\"\"Very likely it’s self-medication,\" said de Roode, adding that the orangutan applied the plant only to the wound and no other body part.MISSOURI ZOO WELCOMES NEWBORN BORNEAN ORANGUTAN JUST BEFORE MOTHER\\'S DAYIt’s possible Rakus learned the technique from other orangutans living outside the park and away from scientists\\' daily scrutiny, said co-author Caroline Schuppli at Max Planck.Rakus was born and lived as a juvenile outside the study area.

It\\'s not known whether Rakus earlier treated other injuries.Scientists have previously recorded other primates using plants to treat themselves.Bornean orangutans rubbed themselves with juices from a medicinal plant, possibly to reduce body pains or chase away parasites.Chimpanzees in multiple locations have been observed chewing on the shoots of bitter-tasting plants to soothe their stomachs. Gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos swallow certain rough leaves whole to get rid of stomach parasites.\"If this behavior exists in some of our closest living relatives, what could that tell us about how medicine first evolved?\" said Tara Stoinski, president and chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, who had no role in the study.'}\n",

As we know exactly where they’re coming from, they have the potential to be placed back into the wild. … So it is very important to keep these corals, as it’s going not very well in the wild,\" Nienke Klerks, a biologist at the Royal Burgers’ Zoo in Arnhem, told The Associated Press.DEEP-SEA DISCOVERY: ANCIENT CORAL MAY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST GLOW-IN-THE-DARK CREATURES, STUDY FINDSIt’s among several projects worldwide seeking to address the decline of coral reef populations, which are suffering from bleaching caused by rising sea temperatures. Corals are central to marine ecosystems, and while these projects won’t stem the tide of damage from human-caused climate change, they are seen as part of broader solutions.The World Coral Conservatory hopes to create a bank of corals in aquariums across Europe that could be used to repopulate wild coral reefs if they succumb to the stress of climate change or pollution.Along with two zoos in France and the originator of the project — the Monaco Scientific Center — the zoo in the east of the Netherlands took in more than a dozen coral fragments from off the coast of Seychelles in east Africa.The Dutch zoo has been propagating the corals since 2022, allowing them to grow in a highly regulated environment before they were large enough to join the rest of the reef.CORAL REEFS AROUND THE WORLD ARE EXPERIENCING MASS BLEACHING IN WARMING OCEANS, SCIENTISTS SAY\"We test it behind the scenes … what works for these corals. In that way, we know where to place them and how to keep them,\" zookeeper Pascal Kik said.Each diver held up a coral — one that resembled a large mushroom, the other a decorative cookie — to be photographed by reporters before placing them on a ledge near the center of the 8-million-liter (2.1-million-gallon) tank.Few of the other corals at the zoo come from the wild. They are either shared by other zoos or turned over by Dutch customs officers after being confiscated. Coral poaching is a major threat to coral reefs in parts of Asia.That would make it difficult to return the corals to the wild. But the team knows exactly where their 14 corals came from, making it more likely they could be successfully reintroduced if needed.Corals area keystone marine species, according to Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society. Eakin, retired coral monitoring chief at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that around 25% of marine animals spend some part of their lives dependent on coral reefs.That makes projects such as the one in Arnhem all the more important to pursue, he said.\"We are in a situation where we really need to be taking any possible action we can,\" Eakin told AP.Earlier in April, scientists from the NOAA and International Coral Reef Initiative said that coral reefs around the world are experiencing global bleaching for the fourth time.Bleaching occurs when coral under stress expels the algae that gives them their vibrant colors. The algae is also a coral’s food source, and if the bleaching lasts for too long or is too severe, the coral could die.In the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, bleaching affected 90% of the coral assessed in 2022. The Florida Coral Reef, the third-largest, experienced significant bleaching last year.Terry Hughes of Australia’s James Cook University, an expert on the Great Barrier Reef, argues that the world needs faster, bolder efforts to stop the damage from climate change, instead of small-scale restoration projects like this one.\"You can’t replace a magnificent ecosystem with an aquarium,\" he said.Others say every little bit helps.\"Coral reefs would be one of the first systems to totally collapse due to climate change,’’ said Ronald Osinga, a marine biologist who specializes in corals at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.\"It’s sad that it has to be like this,\" said Osinga, who is not involved in the Dutch zoo initiative.

So, engineers divided the affected code into sections and planned to move them to various locations in the FDS.NASA PUBLISHES NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN PHOTOS OF ‘RAVIOLI’ MOON ORBITING SATURNEngineers also had to make sure the code worked together as a whole after being moved.Once the code was reconfigured, engineers transmitted the changes to the FDS memory on April 18.The signal takes about 22.5 hours to travel through space until it reaches Voyager 1, and then another 22.5 hours for a signal to come back to earth.VOYAGER 1 DETECTS ‘HUM’ WHILE IN INTERSTELLAR SPACE: REPORTOn April 20, the mission team received a response from Voyager 1 and confirmed the modification worked. As a result, engineers now have the ability to check the health and status of the spacecraft.In the coming months, the team plans to move and adjust additional portions of the FDS software that was affected, including portions that send scientific data back to mission control.Voyager 1′s odyssey began in 1977 when the spacecraft and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched on a tour of the gas giant planets of the solar system.After beaming back dazzling postcard views of Jupiter’s giant red spot and Saturn’s shimmering rings, Voyager 2 hopscotched to Uranus and Neptune. Meanwhile, Voyager 1 used Saturn as a gravitational slingshot to power itself past Pluto.\\xa0'}\n",

Doctors there said there was no indication he died as a result of the experimental transplant.MASSACHUSETTS MAN DIES 2 MONTHS AFTER BECOMING FIRST PERSON TO RECEIVE SUCCESSFUL PIG KIDNEY TRANSPLANTPisano’s heart and kidneys were failing when, in a dramatic pair of surgeries in April, doctors implanted a mechanical pump to keep her heart beating and then the pig kidney.At first she seemed to be recovering well. But Dr. Robert Montgomery, who led the transplant, said there were \"unique challenges\" to managing both the heart pump and new kidney. Her blood pressure dropped too low multiple times for optimal blood flow to the kidney.The kidney lost function until doctors no longer could justify keeping her on immune-suppressing medications, Montgomery said in a statement Friday.A recent kidney biopsy showed no signs of rejection – the biggest concern in highly experimental animal-to-human transplants – but there was \"significant injury\" from insufficient blood flow, he said. NYU will further study the explanted kidney for further insight on how it reacted inside a living person.Montgomery noted Pisano wasn\\'t a candidate for the life-prolonging heart pump while on dialysis, and her heart disease in turn barred a traditional kidney transplant.\"We are hoping to get Lisa back home to her family soon,\" he said. \"Her strength and bravery in the face of adversity inspires and drives us as we continue pursuing the hope and promise of xenotransplantation.\"Pisano told the Associated Press in April that she knew the pig kidney might not work but \"I just took a chance. And you know, worst case scenario, if it didn’t work for me, it might have worked for someone else.\"More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant waiting list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting. In hopes of filling the shortage of donated organs, several biotech companies are genetically modifying pigs so their organs are more humanlike, less likely to be destroyed by people’s immune system.Formal studies of such organs are expected to begin next year.

            "{'title': 'Ask a doctor: ‘Why am I hearing my heartbeat in my ears?’', 'description': 'It can be startling to hear the “whooshing\" sound of your own heartbeat in your ears. Two doctors shared details and insights about what causes this and whether it’s reason for concern.', 'content': 'You’ve likely felt your heart beating in your chest after strenuous activity — or have taken your pulse by placing your fingers on your wrist or neck.A less common — and sometimes startling — sensation is to actually hear the \"whooshing\" sound of your heartbeat in your ears.Fox News Digital reached out to two doctors to learn more about what causes this and whether it’s a cause for concern.ANGER CAN INCREASE HEART ATTACK RISK, STUDY FINDS: ‘CHRONIC INSULT TO ARTERIES’Hearing your heartbeat in your ears — also known by the Latin name \"pulsatile tinnitus\" — isn\\'t always a sign of a medical problem, but it could warrant a discussion with your physician, according to Frederick James Meine, M.D., an interventional cardiologist with Novant Health in Wilmington, North Carolina.\"Many people hear it at one time or another, especially when they are lying down on their side,\" Meine told Fox News Digital.Hearing your heartbeat can be related to ear issues such as wax buildup, fluid in the ear or other hearing issues, Meine said.The most common cause is Eustachian tube dysfunction. This is usually due to allergies, according to Jesus Lizarzaburu, M.D., a family physician with TPMG Grafton Family Medicine in Yorktown, Virginia.\\xa0HALF OF AMERICANS NOT EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT IN A CRISIS, POLL FINDS\"The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of your nose, and when it is blocked or doesn\\'t open and close properly, it can cause the sound of your heartbeat to be heard in your ears,\" he told Fox News Digital.Another culprit could be earwax buildup, which can also cause a seal in the ear canal that makes the heartbeat easier to hear, Lizarzaburu added.Elevated blood pressure is another cause, though less common.On rare occasions, medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), antibiotics, diuretics, chemotherapy medications, aspirin, certain antidepressants, quinine and antivirals can cause tinnitus, a ringing in the ears that is in rhythm with the heart rate, noted Lizarzaburu.\\xa0\"Extremely rare causes would be an aneurysm (a bulge in a blood vessel in the brain) or a vascular tumor, which is made up of a collection of blood vessels,\" he added.A thorough physical exam, including a blood pressure check and an examination of the carotid arteries in the neck, is an important part of gauging overall cardiovascular health, Meine advised.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\"In addition, ruling out anemia or hyperthyroidism, both of which could cause increased blood flow and possibly contribute to pulsatile tinnitus, could be evaluated with simple lab tests,\" he said.If someone experiences the condition intermittently, it is likely less worrisome, the doctor noted.\\xa0\"However, if it is persistent or new-onset, we would perform a complete history and physical exam,\" he said.\\xa0From a cardiovascular perspective, if someone is experiencing pulsatile tinnitus or hearing their heartbeat in their own ears, Meine said it’s important to rule out any potential cardiovascular issues.The doctor would also make sure the patient does not have a blockage or narrowing of the neck arteries, which could contribute to louder heart sounds in the ears and head, he said.\"I do want to stress that most of us occasionally hear our heartbeats in our heads and ears, especially when our heart rate is increased during exercise,\" Meine said.For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health.'}\n",

            "{'title': 'How to easily start an outdoor exercise routine', 'description': 'For those who do not enjoy working out in a gym, exercising outdoors can make a great alternative. Plus, you get the added health benefits of spending time in nature.', 'content': 'Between the sweat smell, fluorescent lights and omnipresent television screens, April Herring has never connected with going to the gym.Instead, she runs, bikes, hikes, plays tennis, pickleball and football — anything to get her exercise outside as often as possible.\"Fresh air, sunshine, the variety of the trees as the seasons change,\" said Herring, an administrator at Carroll Community College in North Maryland. \"There’s something about the energetic healing quality of nature.\"GET THIS FITNESS GEAR THAT’S ACTUALLY COMFORTABLE TO WORKOUT INThe health benefits of spending time in nature have long been established, and exercise in general, of course, improves physical and mental well-being.Combine the two and you double down on what adults need to stay healthy, said Debbie Rhea, professor in kinesiology at Texas Christian University.\"We’ve got to get outside. We’ve got to be active,\" Rhea said. \"If we’re going to live long lives, this is what it’s about.\"Getting started on an outdoor routine, however, might not be as easy as signing up for another gym membership. Here’s how to get going.If you haven’t been active for a while, think back to the activities you enjoyed years ago, suggested Connie Sciolino, founder of the Alpine Training Center in Boulder, Colorado, a gym that trains athletes for outdoor mountain sports.People who like occasionally hiking or biking should start building an aerobic base by taking progressively longer walks or rides. Once you’re comfortably in the 35- to 45-minute range, start adding some intensity to build strength, she said.\"If jogging is their main activity, I would send them to the bleachers or do some up-down on stairs, either in sprint format or put a pack on their back,\" she said.Rhea cautioned against jumping back into a sport you used to play without preparing your body for the proper movement.\"Let’s say they’re in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and they haven’t sprinted and now they try to run around those bases,\" she said. \"They’re probably going to hurt an Achilles or a hamstring or something by doing something too fast.\"A side benefit of exercising outside is that there’s no need to buy expensive equipment, trainers say.After warming up with your preferred aerobic activity, add strength training by using your body weight and what is available in the built environment. That could be finding a picnic table or low wall and placing your hands shoulder-width apart to do leaning pushups. Then turn around, put your hands on the same surface and lower your body for dips that work your triceps.For working your legs, add squats with your feet shoulder-width apart, looking straight ahead with your back straight. Add lunges by taking giant steps and bending down into the space between your feet. For the core, find a patch of grass to do sit-ups.Start with eight to 10 repetitions, or no more than you are comfortable with, and add sets with short breaks in between as you get stronger.For a more complete workout, find a park or trail with outdoor exercise equipment, which is installed in one-third of park agencies, according to the National Recreation and Park Association. The equipment can range from basic pull-up bars to gym-style bench presses and rowing machines.And many cities, including Chicago, San Antonio and Atlanta, offer free group classes outdoors.When it inevitably rains or the weather turns colder, it helps to keep in mind an old axiom: There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.\"If we have the clothing for whatever the temperatures are that we may be in, then we’re more likely to go outside to be active when we need to,\" Rhea said.She suggested investing in a jacket that breathes and a light hat with a brim you can use on sunny or rainy days.Trainer Katie Higginbotham recommended having a contingency plan for inclement weather. Pick an area with surfaces that won’t get slippery when wet or somewhere with some tree shelter so as not to be bombarded by rain.On those days, having a regular exercise buddy really helps, said Higginbotham, who oversees quality control for TrainFitness, a U.K.-based private training provider.\"If you know someone is there waiting for you, it’s difficult to say no at the last minute,\" she said.Finally, it helps to set a goal, whether that is training for a 5K charity walk or a triathlon. If you’re working toward something, it keeps you motivated to keep going, Sciolino said.\"When you have that day marked on your calendar, you have to perform these things or die out there,\" she said.'}\n",

These synthetic substances might be more potent and addictive than traditional nicotine.', 'content': 'Nicotine alternatives used in vapes being launched in the U.S. and abroad, such as 6-methyl nicotine, may be more potent and addictive than nicotine itself, though the scientific data remains incomplete, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and independent researchers.The synthetic substances - which have a chemical structure similar to that of nicotine - are not subject to U.S. tobacco and vaping regulations that are designed to control traditional nicotine, a highly addictive drug.That means manufacturers can sell vapes containing synthetic nicotine analogues such as 6-methyl nicotine in the United States without seeking authorization from the FDA - a process that can be costly, time-consuming and is often unsuccessful.YOUNG VAPER WHO REQUIRED DOUBLE LUNG TRANSPLANT SHARES WARNINGS AS E-CIGARETTE SALES RISEBig tobacco firms like Altria Group and British American Tobacco have already lost substantial U.S. sales to an influx of disposable vapes containing traditional nicotine that are being illegally sold without FDA authorization.Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, highlighted the emerging use of 6-methyl nicotine in vapes and other smoking alternatives in a May 9 letter to the FDA, according to a copy of the correspondence posted on its website.It urged the agency to evaluate the compounds and establish what authority it had over them, warning they posed a \"new threat\" to regulation of the sector.\"The introduction and growth of chemicals intended to imitate the effects of nicotine, if left unchecked, could present unknown risks to U.S. consumers and undermine FDA’s authority,\" the letter said.SMOKING CIGARETTES CAN DESTROY LUNGS, BUT SHOCKING NEW STUDY REVEALS WHY VAPING CAN HARM THE HEARTIt cited SPREE BAR, a vape launched in October by Charlie\\'s Holdings Inc that uses 6-methyl nicotine.The FDA does not comment on its correspondence with individual firms.In response to Reuters\\' questions about 6-methyl nicotine and other nicotine alternatives, the FDA said in a statement: \"Although more research is needed, some emerging data show these nicotine analogs may be more potent than nicotine – which is already highly addictive, can alter adolescent brain development and have long-term effects on youth\\'s attention, learning and memory.\"Traditional nicotine found in many vapes and pouches is extracted from tobacco leaves. 6-methyl nicotine, in contrast, is made entirely in the lab using chemicals.The FDA said it was considering the use of such synthetic compounds from an \"agency-wide perspective\" and would use all of its resources to protect youth from products that may harm their health. As well as tobacco products, the FDA also regulates drugs, foods, cosmetics and more to ensure safety and efficacy.\"The FDA is a data-driven agency, and we\\'re in the process of reviewing the available data to inform potential actions in this space,\" it said in response to Reuters\\' questions.Three academic researchers told the news agency that current studies of 6-methyl nicotine are too limited to draw definite conclusions on the health impact or to what degree it is addictive.Imad Damaj, a professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University, said his research showed 6-methyl nicotine may be more potent than nicotine, but more extensive tests were needed to say what impact it has on humans.The limitations of existing research included that some papers were industry funded, while others focused on the short-term impact on animals or cells and were insufficient to understand 6-methyl nicotine\\'s effects on human bodies, the researchers said.Charlie\\'s Holdings calls the 6-methyl nicotine solution used in SPREE BAR Metatine. SPREE BAR\\'s website says Metatine \"may have a toxicity profile similar to nicotine\".SPREE BAR promises users 6,000 puffs from each device and offers fruity flavors including \"blue razz ice\" and \"creamy melon\", according to its website.The FDA has yet to approve any flavored vape using traditional nicotine for sale in the United States, saying companies have not been able to show that the health benefits they offer to smokers outweigh the known risks to young people, who may be more attracted by the flavors.Charlie\\'s Holdings co-founder Ryan Stump told Reuters that the company only targets adults, adding that flavors played an important role in its mission to help smokers quit cigarettes.Stump said Charlie\\'s Holdings respects and abides by laws in every market where it operates. He acknowledged that more research is needed on 6-methyl nicotine, adding that the company dilutes it in its products.US SCHOOLS INVEST MILLIONS IN SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY TO COMBAT TEEN VAPING EPIDEMICAnes Saleh sells SPREE BAR in his vape shop in Denver, Colorado, called Sultan Smoke. He said he has some customers who only buy Spree Bar instead of a nicotine vape and he hasn\\'t had any negative feedback on the product.\"The only... protest I would hear about people not wanting to try this is that they don\\'t know what Metatine is or does,\" he said.Stump said that Charlie\\'s Holdings is working on new varieties of SPREE BAR and new products using 6-methyl nicotine. It will launch SPREE BAR internationally this year. He declined to say where.The company buys the 6-methyl nicotine solution used in SPREE BAR from another U.S. firm, Novel Compounds, according to Novel Compounds\\' founder Samuel Benaim.Novel Compounds imports 6-methyl nicotine from overseas and alters it to make it easier for manufacturers like Charlie\\'s Holdings to use in their products. It sells this solution under the trade name imotine.Tests commissioned by Novel Compounds have found 6-methyl nicotine to be no more harmful than nicotine, Benaim said. But he also said that more research was needed into the chemical.Benaim added that Novel Compounds had received legal advice that its product is not classified as a tobacco product or drug in the United States. The company is committed to legal compliance, he said.Sven Jordt, a professor at Duke University, who has authored papers on products like SPREE BAR, said 6-methyl nicotine could me more addictive and toxic than its traditional cousin.\"Do we want to have such a chemical as a recreational product, available to anyone?,\" he asked. \"That\\'s really questionable.\"Neither Jordt nor Damaj - the professor at Virginia Commonwealth University - have received funding from tobacco or vape makers.As well as the United States, Novel Compounds also sells its 6-methyl nicotine solution around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, India and Japan.Another company, Aroma King, sells 6-methyl nicotine in the United Kingdom in pouches, which users insert under the lip to get a buzz. The pouches are sold in cans emblazoned with graphics of gorillas in suits and sunglasses.It said in a February blog post that its 6-methyl nicotine products were \"less toxic\", \"less harmful\", and \"less addictive\" than regular nicotine products.In a statement to Reuters, Aroma King cited existing research, its own toxicology and other tests and its supplier, which classifies 6-methyl nicotine as less toxic under the European Union\\'s Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP) Regulation.Aroma King said 6-methyl nicotine was self-classified by its supplier. It declined to say who supplies it with the chemical.Four Chinese companies hold patents in China related to the production of 6-methyl nicotine, including Zinwi Biotech, a company that makes the liquid used in vapes.Zinwi Biotech confirmed it is researching 6-methyl nicotine but did not answer further questions, including on whether it has sold any 6-methyl nicotine so far. Reuters was unable to find contact details for the other firms.'}\n",

Lobby group the National Milk Producers Federation said it encouraged farms to use protective equipment in line with federal recommendations and heard of increased worker protections.Three dairy workers, seven activists and two lawyers who assist farm employees told Reuters that dairy owners have not offered equipment like face shields and goggles to staff who spend 10- to 12-hour days side-by-side with cows. Three large dairy companies with tens of thousands of cows declined to comment on their procedures.The workers - all based in New York, a major dairy producer - said they heard of the new illness affecting cattle through the media or community organizers, not their employers. One, 39-year-old Luis Jimenez from Mexico, said last week it was business as usual.\"They\\'re not doing anything,\" he said.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April and May advised workers to use personal protective equipment (PPE) if they may be exposed to sick livestock, after a Texas dairy worker tested positive for bird flu. On May 6, the agency asked states to make equipment available to workers.CDC wants \"to make sure that farm workers across the country, whether they are at a farm with an affected herd or not, have access to PPE,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, last week.New York state said it is assessing CDC\\'s recommendation and has not yet distributed equipment. Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, where cattle were infected, said they distributed equipment to eight dairies combined. Kansas, Idaho and Wisconsin said they have equipment, but no farmers asked for it.Michigan, where the second dairy worker tested positive, said many farms have protective gear but the state is coordinating a way to make it available for those that need more.Dairies became more aware of bird flu\\'s risks in late April after the U.S. government began requiring that cows test negative before crossing state lines, said Emily Yeiser Stepp, who oversees a National Milk Producers Federation program that covers workforce development.Still, \"reaching out into some of our rural networks takes a little longer,\" she said when told of workers who said they were not informed of recommendations for protective equipment.The U.S. confirmed bird flu in dairy cattle in nine states. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on findings of H5N1 particles in about 20% of retail milk samples.Bird flu has caused serious or fatal infections globally among people in close contact with wild birds or poultry. In cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads.Health experts advise dairy workers to wear gloves and disposable coveralls that can block milk splashes on their bodies or clothing.Jimenez said his coworkers are under pressure to work so quickly that they sometimes do not have time to wash their hands before meals and often drive home in their work clothes.Workers attach and detach milking equipment on cows, putting their faces close to unpasteurized milk. Most are immigrants and many do not have health insurance.\"When you\\'re milking, splashes can\\'t be avoided. When it splashes in our eyes, we wash it out with water,\" said another New York worker, who requested anonymity because he is undocumented.Lucas Sjostrom, a farmer and executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association, uses robotic machines to attach milking equipment to cows, but said he is being extra conscious that human workers wear gloves while transporting unpasteurized milk. Minnesota has not reported bird flu in cows.In Indiana, another state without confirmed cases, farmer Steve Obert said he has not increased precautions for workers, though that could change if his herd tests positive. Extra protective equipment is not comfortable to wear, he added.\"We\\'re rather isolated and I don\\'t think the risk is really great,\" said Obert, executive director of the industry group Indiana Dairy Producers.The infected Texas worker suffered conjunctivitis and broken blood vessels that turned his eyes scarlet red, according to a photo published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He reported wearing gloves when working with cows but not respiratory or eye protection, the journal said.Scientists are watching for changes in the virus that could make it spread more easily among humans. Epidemiologists said it could cause more serious illnesses if it mutates or infects someone with a compromised immune system.Some dairies with infected cows have resisted allowing federal officials on their farms because of financial concerns, said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases.The CDC said it would like to test more farm workers, but it is not required.New Mexico had anecdotal reports of workers with symptoms similar to conjunctivitis, but most were not tested, according to internal state documents that were dated April 26 and obtained by Reuters under a public records request. The workers were not tested because they did not seek healthcare, the New Mexico Department of Health said.Policy changes are needed to encourage workers to seek treatment, such as emergency income assurance for those who test positive, said Brian Castrucci, an epidemiologist and CEO at health policy group the de Beaumont Foundation.\"I don\\'t want to wait until we have a dead dairy farm worker until we ratchet up what we\\'re doing,\" he said.'}\n",

Jump right in!Be sure to find a spot for sunscreen in your backpack. You're going to be spending the whole day, possibly multiple days, in the hot summer sun.\\xa0Even if you put on sunscreen in the morning before you go, you'll want to reapply throughout the day to ensure your skin doesn't burn.\\xa0Burnt shoulders will quickly make your day painful. If you don't have enough room in your bag for a full-sized bottle, you can always get a travel size instead.\\xa0Sunglasses are essential for a day at the theme park. You'll be spending the whole day outside, often stuck directly in the sun while waiting in line.\\xa0HOW TO WEAR SUNSCREEN THE RIGHT WAY: YOUR GUIDE TO SPFJust make sure not to leave your sunglasses on or on top of your head once you get on the ride, or else you'll likely lose them once it takes off.The best place to keep your sunglasses while you ride is safely tucked away in your bag or secured in a closed pocket.\\xa0When you're walking around with the heat surrounding you, a mini portable fan is going to save the day.\\xa0You can even get one that you wear around your neck if you don't want to hold it.\\xa0These fans are a perfect way to enjoy nice cool air as you make your way from ride to ride.\\xa0It's so important to stay hydrated while you are at an amusement park.\\xa0Collapsible water bottles are perhaps the best way to go, as they take up very little space in your bag.\\xa0Buying water at the parks is very expensive, so having your own bottle to refill will save you lots of money.HATE WATER? HERE ARE 5 HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES, ACCORDING TO AN NFL SPORTS DIETITIANMany amusement parks also offer guests souvenir cups that you can refill with your favorite soft drinks throughout the day.\\xa0These are a great option for a practical souvenir you can take home with you.\\xa0You'll want to have your license, credit card and some cash with you while at an amusement park, but a bulky wallet is less than ideal.\\xa0Find something slim that can slip into your bag with ease and fit only the essentials.\\xa0Amazon is full of slim wallets you can choose from for your travels.\\xa0Hungry children (and adults) are no fun at amusement parks. Let's face it, snacks at amusement parks are costly and can add a large expense to your vacation bill.\\xa0Granola bars, trail mix and fruit strips are great snacks to pack in your bag.

This is such a small, easy item to add to your bag.\\xa0Make sure you have lip balm with SPF for extra sun protection.\\xa0Your hair is bound to be wind blown after a roller-coaster ride. Pack plenty of extra hairbands and clips. That way, you can tie up your hair quickly before you ride to avoid inevitable knots and tangles from leaving it down.\\xa0You're also probably going to want to tie up your hair after a few hours in the sun.\\xa0Accidents happen. If they do, you'll be prepared with Band-Aids packed neatly in your bag.\\xa0Blisters are common at amusement parks from walking around all day long.\\xa0Putting a Band-Aid over any blisters that form will keep you going through the day comfortably.\\xa0Check the weather forecast before you head to the park. If there's rain in the forecast, you're going to want a poncho.\\xa0Regular ponchos can take up a lot of space, but an individually wrapped poncho is slim and easy to fit into your bag.\\xa0Even if it's not going to rain, these are helpful to have on water rides, so your clothes don't get soaked.\\xa0This isn't an absolute necessity, as your phone battery is likely to be strong enough to last you the whole day. But, if you are an avid phone user, or your device has a short battery life, a portable phone charger is good to have.\\xa05 TIPS FOR FAMILY TRAVEL THAT COULD MAKE THE EXPERIENCE HAPPIER, HEALTHIER AND MUCH MORE MEMORABLEThere are lots of portable phone chargers that plug directly into your phone without any pesky cords needed. These are great space savers, and you can also easily use your phone while it charges.\\xa0A sweatshirt isn't a necessity, since most likely, it'll be hot most of the day. Consider bringing a sweatshirt only if you plan on staying in the park late, as the temperature will cool as the sun goes down.\\xa0These are going to take up a lot of space, so if you're willing, it may just be easier to purchase a sweatshirt from the gift shop if you get cold at night.\\xa0If you're going to be visiting a water park during your travels, a waterproof phone case is going to come in handy.\\xa0One of the best you can get is a clear pouch that you simply place your phone in and secure shut.

The first is if you go on any water rides during your day in the park, such as a flume ride.If you're wearing socks and sneakers, and they get wet after a water ride, you're in for an uncomfortable rest of the day. Having an extra pair of socks to change into will make you a bit more comfortable.\\xa0Also, while walking around in hot temperatures, you're bound to get a little sweaty. Changing your socks at the halfway point of the day can help you feel (and smell) clean.\\xa0Speaking of smelling clean, a travel-sized deodorant can be a lifesaver when you are feeling sweaty at an amusement park.Swipe a little deodorant on and you'll feel brand new.\\xa0To avoid a hot scalp and the sun beaming in your eyes, keep a hat in your bag.\\xa0CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERThis also helps keep the hair out of your face throughout the day, while also hiding your coaster hair.\\xa0A bucket hat is a great option to have in your bag, since you can fold it up nice and small. You can also clip a baseball hat right onto your bag to save space.\\xa0Plastic bags are a multi-use item that can be extremely helpful at amusement parks.\\xa0If you get a snack, like popcorn, that you don't finish in one sitting, don't throw it away.

It makes sense. In the last 18 months alone, I’ve touched down on all seven continents. But don’t ask me about Türkiye if you’re in a hurry. Despite being a broke 25-year-old when I first visited 10 years ago, I will sing the destination’s praises until I lose my voice. Whether you’re looking for budget-friendly fun or a five-star sojourn (which I’m all about these days), Türkiye has it all. And thanks to\\xa0new nonstop flights from Detroit to Istanbul, it’s never been more accessible. Ideally, you can take a month off to criss-cross the country. But if you only have a week, or two, below is where I’d begin.\\xa0IstanbulIt’s hard not to fall head over heels for this seaside city that straddles two continents and was once the capital of three iconic empires. The locals are sincere, and even the street cats seem like they’re on holiday. Plus everything – from sipping your morning tea (served in a clear glass so you can enjoy the color) to bathing in an underground Turkish hammam – is an inviting experience. I learned the art of the barter in the bustling Grand Bazaar, took in 180-degree views of the Bosphorus from the Galata Tower, and house hunted in the effortlessly hip neighborhood of Karaköy because I wanted to move there so badly after just two nights. Despite being Catholic, I can’t deny that the Hagia Sophia is the most stunning house of worship I’ve ever stepped foot in.\\xa0Pro tip: Wear socks; shoes aren’t allowed in mosques.\\xa0BodrumA coastal city of contrasts, Bodrum is where the traditional wooden gulet I was on for an 8-night Sun Fun You cruise docked next to a multi-million dollar fiberglass yacht. This port city along the boasts Yalıkavak Marina, one of Europe’s finest marinas where you can shop in Dior and dine at Zuma. But it’s also home to the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. While exploring on foot – everywhere in the old town is walkable – I saw remnants of Bodrum’s previous life as a quiet fishing village. In the evenings, however, I drank and danced my way up Bar Street, a mile-long strip specializing in nightlife. And forget FOMO. Thanks to the laidback Turkaegean way of life, I was fully present and even the mundane moments felt magical.Pro tip: Don’t miss the \"Anatolia show\", where martial arts meet acrobats, at the city’s oldest club,\\xa0Halikarnas.\\xa0CappadociaCappadocia is more than the hot air balloon capital of the world. It’s rich in history (take a tour of Derinkuyu, a subterranean city dating back to the 7th century BCE, or explore Göreme’s mysterious cave churches) and chock full of geographic formations. From whimsical 100-foot-tall fairy chimneys to a snow-covered 12,851-foot-tall inactive volcano, this part of Central \\u200b\\u200bTürkiye\\xa0is made for the ‘gram. Here, it’s all about perspective, hence the hundreds of hot air balloon safaris that launch daily. Still, many think this magical landscape is best enjoyed on horseback. And don’t forget to embrace your inner sommelier and sample the region’s fine wines. Cappadocia’s fertile soil produces the rare Emir grape, among other renowned varieties.\\xa0Pro tip: Make your own ceramic souvenir at Avanos Pottery Workshop or shop for a hand-woven rug in Cappadocia’s colorful bazaars.\\xa0TrabzonA former Silk Road hub hugging the Black Sea and surrounded by mountains, Trabzon appeals to my inner adrenaline junkie. My bucket list includes paragliding over Uzungöl Lake, a popular alpine escape for adventurers, laying first tracks at Zigana Ski Centre, one of more than 40 ski resorts in the country, and hiking to the Sumela Monastery, a Greek Orthodox engineering marvel dating back to the 4th century CE. It’s carved out of a cliff and on clear days, offers breathtaking views of the always verdant Altindere Valley National Park below. Of course, no trip to Trabzon is complete without refueling with Akçaabat köftesi (fried meatballs).\\xa0Pro tip: If you’re not claustrophobic, go spelunking at Cal Cave, the self-proclaimed second-longest cave system in the world.\\xa0AntalyaThe beating heart of the Turkish Riviera is blessed with 231 Blue Flag Beaches. For comparison, the U.S. has just two. But there’s so much more to this resort-filled region than world-class sand and surf. Just 55 miles north of the city, a crystal clear river meanders through Köprülü Canyon National Park – a natural playground for rafters, campers, and hikers. Closer to town, the dramatic Duden Waterfalls are a popular place to picnic. The Lower Falls even cascade over a cliff into the sea. Antalya, with its Roman, Ottoman Turkish, Seljuk Turkish, and Eastern Roman influences, doesn’t disappoint in the culture department either. Its 2,000-year-old Aspendos – the best preserved theater from the ancient world – still hosts concerts, operas, and ballets. And Kaleiçi, Antalya’s old town, is a living, open-air museum.\\xa0Pro tip: Embrace your inner emperor and enter Kaleiçi through the triple-arched Hadrian’s Gate, built specifically for the Roman ruler’s visit in 130 CE.\\xa0Katie Jackson is a freelance travel writer.

The wording suggests the company didn’t have direct access to the leaked database. Still, the post revealed plenty of information about the incident and the threat actors behind the attack.The hacking groups EquationCorp and USDoD are reportedly responsible for a major data breach involving the criminal record database. The breach, which resulted in the online leak of the database, contains 70 million entries. It includes the full names, dates of birth, known aliases, addresses, arrest and conviction dates, sentences and other information of millions of Americans who had encounters with the U.S. justice system between 2020 and 2024.We contacted Malwarebytes and spoke with Pieter Arntz, a security researcher at the company, who informed us that they were able to obtain a small sample of the criminal records, which are specific to individual incidents. Each entry represents either an arrest or a case rather than a comprehensive compilation of all crimes committed by a single person. In other words, these records provide a snapshot of discrete legal events rather than a comprehensive overview of an individual’s criminal history.\\xa0The exact source of this database is unknown. However, the hacker group USDoD, a major player in the field, is closely linked to \"Pompompurin,\" the operator of the original data leak site BreachForums. According to Malwarebytes, USDoD plans to create a successor to the second version of BreachForums, which was recently shut down by law enforcement. By releasing this database, USDoD might be trying to attract new users.The same hacker is also believed to be involved in a breach at TransUnion, the data from which was partly dumped in September 2023.MASSIVE DELL DATA BREACH HITS 49 MILLION USERS — WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR PRIVACY AND SECURITYIf you\\'ve had a run-in with the law before, there\\'s a good chance that a bunch of the info you shared with law enforcement is now out there on the web. The exposure of such a comprehensive criminal database could have significant implications for law enforcement, judicial proceedings and the individuals mentioned within the dataset.The hackers who pulled off the leak might be looking to make a quick buck by selling your data to shady characters on the dark web. They might also try to con you by pretending to be someone you trust or a legit company, aiming to get their hands on some cash.This much bulk data can also be used by bad actors to threaten, harass and blackmail people with records similar to the Ashley Madison breach. For the unaware, In July 2015, a hacker group calling itself \"The Impact Team\" stole the user data of Ashley Madison, a commercial website billed as enabling extramarital affairs. These hackers copied personal information from the user base and threatened to expose users\\' names and personal details unless Ashley Madison shut down right away.WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?SNEAKY SPYWARE IS AFTER YOUR MOST SENSITIVE DATAIf you suspect you\\'ve been impacted by this data breach, follow these steps to protect your personal data and privacy.1. Invest in identity theft protection: If you think your personal data has been leaked, scammers may try to impersonate you to gain access to your private information. The best thing you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service.Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.\\xa02. Place a fraud alert: Contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file.

Check Social Security benefits: It is crucial to periodically check your Social Security benefits to ensure they have not been tampered with or altered in any way, safeguarding your financial security and preventing potential fraud.\\xa05. Invest in removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for removal services here.6. Change your password: You can render a stolen password useless to thieves simply by changing it. Opt for a strong password — one you don\\'t use elsewhere. Even better, consider letting a password manager generate one for you.AT&T DATA LEAK FROM 73 MILLION CUSTOMERS — WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NEXTThe fact that threat actors were able to leak such a comprehensive amount of data suggests serious loopholes in government systems.

Various factors can impact your iPhone’s battery life quality and quantity.\"Hi, if your iPhone is plugged in and finishes charging, does it damage [the] phone or charger if it is left plugged in at 100% during the night? Also, does leaving the charger plugged in when not in use hurt the charger? Thank you.\" — Gail, Clifton, NJThe short answer to your question is, \"Yes,\" Gail. While it may not damage your iPhone, it can impact the lifespan of your phone’s battery. Leaving your phone plugged in overnight is not a bad idea, as phones are smart enough to prevent an overload. Charging stops once the internal lithium-ion battery hits 100% of its capacity. However, if you leave your phone plugged in overnight, it will use a bit of energy by constantly trickling new juice into the battery every time it falls to 99%. That is eating into your phone’s lifespan.As for your second question, leaving your charger plugged in when not in use does not damage it. The charger will only draw power when connected to a device that needs charging, so you can leave it plugged in without worrying about damaging it.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE NEWSLETTER, THE CYBERGUY REPORTMost modern mobile phones are powered by lithium batteries, which are lighter, last longer, charge faster and have more power density. Battery life depends on its chemical age, based on its temperature and charge history. As the battery life chemically ages, the amount of charge the battery can hold is reduced. By staying mindful about how and how often you charge your phone, you can extend the life of your battery. Below are some ways to take care of your phone\\'s battery.HOW TO PROTECT IPHONES & IPADS FROM MALWAREMaximize your iPhone’s battery life and performance with these 10 essential tips to keep it running efficiently and safely.1. Do not let your iPhone overheat through external or internal temperature exposure. Make sure your phone isn’t overheating in its phone case while charging. If so, take it off to ensure enough ventilation around your phone.2. Try not to use your iPhone while it is charging. If you can wait until it is sufficiently charged, do wait because using your phone while charging can cause it to overwork, increasing the phone’s temperature and causing stress or damage.5 WAYS TO CHARGE YOUR MOBILE DEVICE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE3. Avoid buying cheap wall plug chargers. While buying the ones half the price is tempting, the officially branded wall plug chargers are manufactured with circuits specially created for your phone that prevent overcharging, breaking or overheating.BEST ACCESSORIES FOR YOUR PHONE4. I recommend not downloading battery performance apps from third parties. Most phones already come with this data, and these additional apps are draining their batteries. They can also be a risk for malware, viruses and bloatware.5. Be sure to turn off ‘Background App Refresh’ for apps you don’t need running all the time or selectively when your battery life is low.ASK ANY TECH QUESTION, AND GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER HEREWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?6. Use only official chargers and cables. If you must shop third-party brands, make sure they are Apple MFi certified for non-Apple accessories and USB-IF certified to replace Android accessories.7. Use the optimized battery charging option on your iPhone. It will help reduce the wear on your iPhone’s battery by lowering the time it stays fully charged. When this option is utilized, it will prevent your phone from charging past 80%. It learns your battery use habits to determine how long it takes to charge your phone.

Most mobile devices include battery-use data. Once you can determine which apps or activities eat up most of your battery life, you can close them or use them less when you need to conserve battery life.9. Be careful of what portable battery chargers you use on the go. While they can be powerful and helpful in a pinch, some can cause damage. Buy from reputable Apple MFi-certified brands for non-Apple accessories and USB-IF certified to replace Android accessories.10. Adjust screen brightness.

Its compact dimensions allow for easy maneuvering through traffic, reducing the risk of accidents.

These powerful tools are essential for safeguarding your online activities and maintaining privacy against ever-evolving cyberthreats. Despite widespread recognition of their benefits, many users, like Beth, who recently contacted us, encounter challenges in effectively leveraging VPNs.\"Hi. I recently had some jerk hack my Amazon account and cause all sorts of problems and I believe they also hacked my Etsy account. … Anyway, I wanted to start using a VPN since 99% of my time both for work and at home is spent online and the same for my son and my husband. However, we noticed that a HUGE number of sites want to block people who are using VPNs. Do you have a suggestion for a VPN that is less likely to be blocked or noticed or however that works?\" —\\xa0Beth, Verbena, AlabamaHey Beth, I’m sorry to hear that you had to go through such an ordeal. It’s understandable that you want to protect your online privacy and security by using a VPN. However, it’s true that some websites block VPN connections to prevent fraudulent activities and protect their own security. Below are the reasons why VPN connections are blocked and how to circumvent that.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE NEWSLETTER, THE CYBERGUY REPORTMajor paid VPN services invest significant resources into evading VPN blocking by websites and services. Their server networks are large and constantly rotating IP addresses, making it harder to blacklist.Free VPN services tend to have smaller server networks and get their IP address ranges blacklisted more easily by anti-VPN measures. Paid providers are generally better at bypassing blocks.Many VPNs offer an obfuscation or camouflage mode that disguises VPN traffic as regular internet traffic, helping evade deep packet inspection used to identify VPNs.Some VPN providers offer browser extensions that can sometimes bypass VPN blocks when the desktop app fails. The extensions route only the browser traffic through the VPN.No VPN is 100% unblockable, but following these tips can help find a service that minimizes the chances of being blocked when trying to access restricted websites and services.MORE: HOW TO USE VPNs WITHOUT COMPROMISING YOUR BANKING APPSRegarding your online privacy, it’s true that companies like Google have been caught taking information they were not given permission to access. However, it’s important to note that websites have the right to block VPN connections if they suspect fraudulent activities. This is because VPNs can be used to mask the identity of the user and bypass geographical restrictions, which can be used for illegal activities. Below are the top four reasons VPN connections are blocked.1) Transparency: Financial institutions, in particular, often block VPNs because they want to preserve the transparency of transactions. In short, these institutions have a vested interest in seeing where and who the funds are coming and going. PayPal actually will go as far as to ban VPN users for life as it violates their Terms of Service agreements.2) Limiting services: Streaming services do not want users to use VPN because it bypasses specific region-based restrictions. Certain content is only available to specific regions of the world, and VPN would mask the user\\'s location.\\xa0Streaming services actively block VPN IP addresses, and if it is discovered you managed to bypass their IP blacklists with a regular VPN or VPN obfuscation, you can come under \"fire\" from the streaming services.3) Preventing illegal activities: Some governments and companies utilize VPN blocking to ensure that they are protected against misuse, fraud, and other illegal activities.4) Control: Some governments and companies use VPN blocking to monitor and trace back activities by individuals online. For instance, some companies ban VPN use, limiting nonwork access online, etc.ASK ANY TECH QUESTION AND GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER HEREMORE: HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOT SPOT PRIVACY, SECURITY WITH VPNOne effective way to bypass VPN blocking is to connect to a different VPN server location or city. Many websites and services that attempt to block VPNs do so by blacklisting known VPN IP address ranges. By switching to a VPN server in a different city or country, you can obtain a new IP address that may not be blocked.Most reputable VPN providers have a large global server network spanning hundreds or thousands of servers across dozens of countries. This gives you many options to try different server locations until you find one that is not blocked by the website or service you\\'re trying to access.The steps are usually:By changing your virtual location frequently, you make it much harder for anti-VPN measures to keep up with blacklisting all the IP addresses associated with a particular VPN service.Consider using a VPN to protect against being tracked and to identify your potential location on websites that you visit.\\xa0Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location. See my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.MORE: WILL A VPN PREVENT APPS FROM TRACKING ME?Given the tremendous amounts of personal data gleaned through daily online use, it is understandable why you might want to utilize a VPN service. Unfortunately, some companies and government agencies block VPN users, which is completely legal.

In this particular scam, scammers send their victims phishing emails pretending to send them a large invoice for their Geek Squad subscription. The email recipients usually panic at the large charge and call the customer service telephone number listed in the scam email and invoice.\\xa0The scammer then pretends to be the customer service representative helping to cancel or refund the charge. They’ll usually use that moment as an opportunity to confirm bank account information with the victim to steal their money later. Even if you simply click on their links or download the invoice from the email, there is a potential risk that viruses or malware have been downloaded onto your device.\\xa0MORE: THE ‘UNSUBSCRIBE’ EMAIL SCAM IS TARGETING AMERICANSThe elderly victim gave her bank account number and remote access to her computer. The scam, however, doesn’t just stop there. The scammer went a step further and proceeded to convince this elderly woman that they had accidentally refunded a fake $25,000 into her bank account by mistake and that he needed her to withdraw $20,000 in cash initially for him to pick up with arrangements to pick up the remaining $5,000 the following day. This is when the elderly woman called her local authorities. Thankfully, the authorities set up surveillance and apprehended the scammer when he came to collect the $20,000.\\xa0Perhaps the elderly victim lucked out that this scammer had an extra level of greed: combining multiple scams into one.\\xa0MORE: 7 EFFECTIVE WAYS TO MAKE YOUR LIFE MORE SECURE AND PRIVATE ONLINEKnow your subscriptions: The better you know what active subscriptions you currently pay for, the less likely you are to realize such emails are fake.\\xa0Organize your invoices: If you’re still receiving emails or physical invoices, keep track of when they usually arrive. Invoices, for better or worse, come regularly and on a consistent schedule. If something shows up in an unusual form (an email instead of a letter in the mail per usual) or at a particular time, you are more likely to stop yourself from falling for this type of scam.Go to the official website for contact information. If the scammers happen to pick a company that you do subscribe to, it can be even easier to fall for this type of scam. But before clicking any links, downloading any invoices or calling the number listed, you can google the company’s official website and use the contact information there. If the company did indeed send you a bill, they should be able to help you with the refund or confirm whether you were sent legitimate communications.Watch for language and tone of voice: Most legitimate companies go out of their way to specially train their employees to provide their customers with excellent service. They are trained not to lose their temper, so if you happen to be on a call with a scammer, they often don’t use professional language or have a professional demeanor. If you push back on providing certain information, a real customer service agent wouldn’t make any threats or demands. Providing Social Security numbers or bank account information is usually frowned upon for security reasons by legitimate companies. Legitimate companies typically have other ways to validate your identity and account information. You can always hang up the phone if you get overwhelmed on a call! After all, an honest company doesn’t disappear after one disconnection.\\xa0Setup payments electronically: If you have your subscriptions paid electronically on a regular basis, you’ll know that you shouldn’t be receiving an additional invoice for a subscription service. Additionally, if you are paying with a credit card, you can try to use a specific card for all your subscriptions so you know where and when to expect the charges.

Change passwords: For any accounts that might have been accessed or mentioned to or by the scammer, you should log in from a secure, virus- and malware-free device and change your password immediately. It is best to create unique and complex passwords, including letters, symbols and numbers, for each separate online account. If you need help generating and storing complex passwords, consider using a password manager.2. Keep an eye on all your accounts and credit consistently: Contact the financial institution and explain the situation for all accounts impacted by the potential scammer. They can help you freeze or lock your account, so these scammers have little or no access to your money. Contact the three main credit bureaus to freeze your credit. This will prevent anyone, including hackers, from wreaking havoc on your credit. Make sure to report any errors on your credit reports with the credit agencies. Remember that you are allowed a free annual credit report. If there are too many accounts for you to keep track of regularly, a credit monitoring service can help by constantly monitoring and alerting you of any account changes or problems.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE3. Setup alerts for financial accounts: Most financial institutions offer financial alerts or restrictions for all transactions for checking accounts and cards. Do use them so you can be notified of any fraudulent transactions immediately. The faster you can report these charges to your financial institution, the more likely you can stop the scammers in their tracks.4. Enable two-factor authentication for any account impacted by the phishing scam: This would include your financial accounts and email address. If you have this additional layer of security on, the hacker or scammer would have to send a code to another device or account to gain access, even with your password.\\xa05. Get Identity Theft Protection: While getting an identity theft service seems overkill, many identity theft protection services can help you when your accounts get compromised. They continually monitor the dark web and your financial accounts to see if any crucial personal information like your email addresses or bank account information is compromised or up for sale on the dark web. Getting those alerts immediately allows you to act faster and take the above-mentioned steps.\\xa0If you have already given out your information to a potential scammer, you should follow these steps to ensure that your identity hasn’t been stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.6.

And because you don\\'t need to go back into a physical classroom to learn those skills anymore (something that can be very anxiety-inducing for some people), taking the leap to study may be much less daunting when you can do it online.Whether you\\'re looking for a career change, want to stay relevant at your current job or are looking for something to do post-retirement, why not try something new?There are so many websites that offer low-cost or even free courses where you can advance your skills on your own time without having to borrow thousands of dollars or change your routine and dedicate yourself to it full time.GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HEREASK ANY TECH QUESTION AND GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER HEREIf one of the reasons you\\'re looking to learn a new skill is that you\\'re interested in a higher-paying job, that\\'s understandable. Or maybe someone younger than you is asking for advice, and you want to give them some tips on what they can pursue. Perhaps you\\'re just curious about what the highest-paying jobs are these days. Whatever the reason, it\\'s good to be current on these questions.Though year after year doctors, lawyers, accountants and electrical engineers are at the top of the list of the highest-paying jobs, that\\'s not always the most realistic career path for everyone, especially if you\\'re looking to skill up quickly for a career change or a hobby. In either case – or maybe you\\'re just curious – here are the highest-paying jobs in 2024, according to several sources like Yahoo! Finance, Indeed and U.S. News Money.CLICK HERE FOR MORE US NEWSBEST LAPTOPS OF 2024The quick answer? No, not necessarily. But it will take some skill leveling up. You can get some of these roles by educating yourself online or enrolling in online courses. And these courses don\\'t typically ask you for a degree to enroll.Why? They understand that a person might want to learn new skills for many reasons. Of course, if getting a higher-paid job or wanting a promotion is your reason for learning a new skill in the first place, then certainly having some college education may help you land one of these jobs sooner.HOW TO KNOW IF YOUR COMPUTER GOT HACKED - WHAT TO DO NEXTIS YOUR BOSS SPYING ON YOU?\\xa0There are several excellent online platforms where you can continue your education, acquire new skills and explore various subjects.

Again, the whole purpose of online learning is to make it accessible to everyone. So, even though there may be other students in your cohort who are younger or at a totally different stage of their careers or their lives, don\\'t let that hold you back.Learning a new skill, even if you\\'ve been in your career for decades, can help you stay on top of your game as new tech and trends roll in. If you\\'re a parent or a grandparent, learning a new skill can help you relate more to your children as they grow and pursue their careers. And, if you\\'re near retirement or already retired, learning a new skill helps keep the mind sharp and maybe even gives you the education you need to start a new venture.Choosing the best online course depends on several factors.

Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from £19 to £29. More than 2.8 million DS consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March. The PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite Sony\\'s assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.\\n\\nThe 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo\\'s Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft\\'s Rayman DS.\\n\\nMore than 120 games are in development for the new console, Nintendo has said. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine\\'s back catalogue of 700 games to be played. Additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the DS, with a \"download play\" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. Other features include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega\\'s launch title Project Rub. Nintendo has also announced a media adapter, which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.\\n\\nThe launch price of £99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. \"It\\'s a very, very competitive price point. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo has created quite a buzz,\" he says. \"However, the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example.\"\\n\\nMr Houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony\\'s new PSP, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. \"The PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Sony\\'s attitude to the PSP has been very understated in Europe, so far,\" Mr Houlihan said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analysts Screen Digest.\\n\\nIn the past, games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other parts of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was \"pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch\". \"Europe is an extremely important market for Nintendo,\" Mr Iwata added. Nintendo raised its sales targets for the DS console last December after selling a million in the US and Japan in just a few weeks.\\n'"

The state Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s dismissal of that lawsuit, but the majority rejected arguments from voting rights groups that the measure violates state constitutional voting rights.KANSAS GOV. KELLY TO CALL SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION OVER TAX CUTSIn fact, Justice Caleb Stegall, writing for the majority, said that the dissenting justices wrongly accused the majority of ignoring past precedent, holding that the court has not identified a \"fundamental right to vote\" within the state constitution.\"It simply is not there,\" Stegall wrote.Justice Eric Rosen, one of the three who dissented, shot back: \"It staggers my imagination to conclude Kansas citizens have no fundamental right to vote under their state constitution.\"\"I cannot and will not condone this betrayal of our constitutional duty to safeguard the foundational rights of Kansans,\" Rosen added.Conversely, the high court unanimously sided with the challengers of a different provision that makes it a crime for someone to give the appearance of being an election official. Voting rights groups, including Kansas League of Women Voters and the nonprofit Loud Light, argued the measure suppresses free speech and their ability to register voters as some might wrongly assume volunteers are election workers, putting them at risk of criminal prosecution.A Shawnee County District Court judge had earlier rejected the groups\\' request for an emergency injunction, saying that impersonation of a public official is not protected speech.But the high court faulted the new law, noting that it doesn\\'t include any requirement that prosecutors show intent by a voter registration volunteer to misrepresent or deceive people into believing they\\'re an election official, and it thus \"criminalizes honest speech\" where \"occasional misunderstandings\" are bound to occur, Stegall wrote in the majority opinion.\"As such, it sweeps up protected speech in its net,\" Stegall said.Because the lawsuit over the false impersonation law\\'s constitutionality is likely to succeed, the state Supreme Court ordered the lower court to reconsider issuing an emergency injunction against it.\"For three years now, Kansas League of Women Voters volunteers have been forced to severely limit their assistance of voters due to this ambiguous and threatening law,\" said Martha Pint, president of the chapter. \"The League’s critical voter assistance work is not a crime, and we are confident this provision will be quickly blocked when the case returns to the district court.\"Loud Light executive director Davis Hammet said he hopes the lower court \"will stop the irreparable harm caused daily by the law and allow us to resume voter registration before the general election.\"Neither Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab nor state Attorney General Kris Kobach responded to requests for comment on that portion of the high court\\'s ruling.Instead, in a joint statement, Schwab and Kobach focus on the high court\\'s language bolstering the signature verification law and its upholding of a provision that says individuals may collect no more than 10 advance ballots to submit to election officials.\"This ruling allows us to preserve reasonable election security laws in Kansas,\" Schwab said.Supporters have argued the ballot collection restriction combats \"ballot harvesting\" and limits voter fraud. The GOP-led Legislature passed it over a veto by Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. Critics have said it\\'s a Republican reaction to baseless claims that the 2020 election was not valid, which prompted a wave of misinformation and voter suppression laws across the country.Last year, the Kansas Court of Appeals reinstated a lawsuit challenging the ballot collection limitation and the signature verification, saying both impair the right to vote. But the high court upheld the limit on ballot collections, saying \"voters have numerous avenues available to deliver their ballots\" and that ballot collecting doesn\\'t fall within the parameters of free speech.Kobach defended the majority\\'s opinion as \"well-reasoned\" and confirms that the Legislature has the constitutional authority to establish proofs \"to ensure voters are who they say they are.\"\"And that is exactly what Kansas’s signature verification requirement is,\" Kobach said.'}\n",

Wade was overturned in 2022.In a unanimous ruling, the court upheld the Texas law after the women filed a lawsuit in March 2023 seeking clarity on when exceptions to the abortion ban are permitted, arguing the law was confusing for doctors who might turn away patients over fears of repercussions.The same issue was at the center of a separate lawsuit brought last year by Dallas mother Kate Cox, who sought court permission to obtain an abortion after her fetus developed a fatal condition during a pregnancy that resulted in multiple trips to an emergency room. She eventually left the state to have the procedure.MAN FINED FOR STANDING SILENTLY OUTSIDE UK ABORTION CLINIC, OFFICERS COULDN\\'T TELL HIM HIS CRIMEThe court said Friday that the law\\'s exceptions are broad enough and that doctors would be misinterpreting the law if they decided not to perform an abortion when the mother\\'s life is in danger.\"Texas law permits a life-saving abortion,\" the court wrote in the order signed by Justice Jane Bland.The decision closed, at least for now, another pathway for opponents who have attempted to force the state to provide more clarity about when exceptions to abortions are allowed. Last year, plaintiffs in the lawsuit testified in court how they carried babies they knew would not survive and continued with pregnancies that put their health at risk.Plaintiff Kaitlyn Kash, whose fetus developed severe skeletal dysplasia, was told even the simplest movements could break its bones in utero. Her life was not threatened, but she still chose to leave Texas for an abortion.\"I wanted to end my child’s pain before it could begin,\" Kash said. \"The state just told me that as a mother, I don’t have the right to make those decisions for my child. ... If you want to grow your family, if you want to have children, you should get out of Texas.\"The Texas law states that doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison, fines of up to $100,000 and could lose their state medical licenses.\"Now we know the courthouse doors are closed to them,\" said Molly Duane, a staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented the group of Texas women. \"It seems Texans have nowhere to go but the voting booth, in terms of what comes next.\"Last year, a lower court granted a temporary injunction preventing Texas from enforcing the ban against doctors who performed an abortion using their \"good faith judgment\" after determining a pregnancy was unsafe due to medical complications. That ruling, however, was immediately blocked after an appeal from the Texas attorney general\\'s office to the state’s Supreme Court.The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, Amanda Zurawski, had been told that she had a condition that her baby would not survive. She said she was forced to wait until she was diagnosed with a life-threatening case of sepsis before obtaining an abortion. She spent three days in intensive care and was left with a permanently closed fallopian tube from an infection, affecting her ability to have more children.The court ruled Friday that state law does not require that a woman\\'s death or serious impairment be \"imminent\" when she is evaluated by a doctor for a potential abortion.\"Ms. Zurawski\\'s agonizing wait to be ill \\'enough\\' for induction, her development of sepsis, and her permanent physical injury are not the results the law commands,\" the court wrote.Zurawski said the ruling was \"heartbreaking.\"\"I am outraged on behalf of my fellow plaintiffs who the Court deemed not sick enough,\" Zurawski said. \"We all deserve bodily autonomy. Every day, people in Texas are being told that they have no options. It’s sickening and wrong.\"Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton praised the ruling after his office defended the law in this case.LOUISIANA CLASSIFIES ABORTION DRUGS AS CONTROLLED, DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES AFTER GOV. LANDRY GREENLIGHTS PROPOSAL\"I will continue to defend the laws enacted by the Legislature and uphold the values of the people of Texas by doing everything in my power to protect mothers and babies,\" Paxton posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.The lawsuit argued that exemptions under the Texas law, which allow an abortion to save a mother\\'s life or prevent the impairment of a major bodily function, led to confusion among doctors, who were turning away some pregnant women experiencing health complications because they feared repercussions.The plaintiffs said the abortion ban, which allows an abortion to save a mother\\'s life or prevent the impairment of a major bodily function, has made doctors fear of potential liability if the state does not consider a case a medical emergency.New guidelines proposed by the state medical board earlier this year did not provide much beyond advising doctors to meticulously document their decision-making.

The orangutan then used his fingers to apply the plant juices to an injury on the right cheek. Afterward, he pressed the chewed plant to cover the open wound like a makeshift bandage, according to a new study in Scientific Reports.Previous research has documented several species of great apes foraging for medicines in forests to heal themselves, but scientists hadn\\'t yet seen an animal treat itself in this way.ZOO JOY: HEARTS MELT WHEN ORANGUTAN \\'ASKS\\' TO SEE BABY THROUGH ENCLOSURE, THEN \\'KISSES\\' GLASS\"This is the first time that we have observed a wild animal applying a quite potent medicinal plant directly to a wound,\" said co-author Isabelle Laumer, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany.The orangutan\\'s intriguing behavior was recorded in 2022 by Ulil Azhari, a co-author and field researcher at the Suaq Project in Medan, Indonesia. Photographs show the animal’s wound closed within a month without any problems.Scientists have been observing orangutans in Indonesia’s Gunung Leuser National Park since 1994, but they hadn’t previously seen this behavior.\"It’s a single observation,\" said Emory University biologist Jacobus de Roode, who was not involved in the study. \"But often we learn about new behaviors by starting with a single observation.\"\"Very likely it’s self-medication,\" said de Roode, adding that the orangutan applied the plant only to the wound and no other body part.MISSOURI ZOO WELCOMES NEWBORN BORNEAN ORANGUTAN JUST BEFORE MOTHER\\'S DAYIt’s possible Rakus learned the technique from other orangutans living outside the park and away from scientists\\' daily scrutiny, said co-author Caroline Schuppli at Max Planck.Rakus was born and lived as a juvenile outside the study area. Researchers believe the orangutan got hurt in a fight with another animal. It\\'s not known whether Rakus earlier treated other injuries.Scientists have previously recorded other primates using plants to treat themselves.Bornean orangutans rubbed themselves with juices from a medicinal plant, possibly to reduce body pains or chase away parasites.Chimpanzees in multiple locations have been observed chewing on the shoots of bitter-tasting plants to soothe their stomachs. Gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos swallow certain rough leaves whole to get rid of stomach parasites.\"If this behavior exists in some of our closest living relatives, what could that tell us about how medicine first evolved?\" said Tara Stoinski, president and chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, who had no role in the study.'}\n",

Doctors there said there was no indication he died as a result of the experimental transplant.MASSACHUSETTS MAN DIES 2 MONTHS AFTER BECOMING FIRST PERSON TO RECEIVE SUCCESSFUL PIG KIDNEY TRANSPLANTPisano’s heart and kidneys were failing when, in a dramatic pair of surgeries in April, doctors implanted a mechanical pump to keep her heart beating and then the pig kidney.At first she seemed to be recovering well. But Dr. Robert Montgomery, who led the transplant, said there were \"unique challenges\" to managing both the heart pump and new kidney. Her blood pressure dropped too low multiple times for optimal blood flow to the kidney.The kidney lost function until doctors no longer could justify keeping her on immune-suppressing medications, Montgomery said in a statement Friday.A recent kidney biopsy showed no signs of rejection – the biggest concern in highly experimental animal-to-human transplants – but there was \"significant injury\" from insufficient blood flow, he said. NYU will further study the explanted kidney for further insight on how it reacted inside a living person.Montgomery noted Pisano wasn\\'t a candidate for the life-prolonging heart pump while on dialysis, and her heart disease in turn barred a traditional kidney transplant.\"We are hoping to get Lisa back home to her family soon,\" he said. \"Her strength and bravery in the face of adversity inspires and drives us as we continue pursuing the hope and promise of xenotransplantation.\"Pisano told the Associated Press in April that she knew the pig kidney might not work but \"I just took a chance. And you know, worst case scenario, if it didn’t work for me, it might have worked for someone else.\"More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant waiting list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting. In hopes of filling the shortage of donated organs, several biotech companies are genetically modifying pigs so their organs are more humanlike, less likely to be destroyed by people’s immune system.Formal studies of such organs are expected to begin next year. Meanwhile, NYU and other research teams have temporarily transplanted pig kidneys and hearts into brain-dead bodies, with promising results. In addition to the Mass General pig kidney transplant, the University of Maryland transplanted pig hearts into two men who were out of other options, and both died within months.'}\n",

But from bees to butterflies, insect populations have been in decline in recent decades — a drop often blamed on human causes such as the use of damaging chemicals, destruction of natural habitats and climate change.Breitkreuz points to people’s lack of knowledge of \"what is crawling around outside their door\" as one contributing factor. \"It’s very important for us to show people how important, great and interesting insects are,\" she says.Organizers have prepared a form and a mobile app to help people identify and report their firebug and lacewing sightings during this year’s two insect-counting events.

As the parrots soar squawking past their home, the couple can readily identify bird No. 17 by its smooth feathers and can tell No. 16 from No. 22, which has two beads attached to its radio collar.This familiarity offers a glimpse of the South African couple’s commitment to saving one of the world\\'s most critically endangered species. The parrot — endemic to a small fraction of the Sao Francisco River basin and already rare in the 19th century — was declared extinct in the wild in 2000, when a lonely surviving male disappeared following decades of poaching and habitat destruction from livestock overgrazing. The few remaining birds were scattered in private collections around the world.For the Spix\\'s macaws, immortalized in the popular animated \"Rio\" films, the road back from the edge of extinction has been a long, winding and bumpy one.SCIENTISTS SAY ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS AS ESSENTIAL AS EVER AFTER 50 YEARS OF SUCCESSThreats that had devastated the Spix’s macaws still loom, and the birds now face another menace: climate change. The species’ original territory overlaps what has recently been officially designated Brazil’s first arid climate region.The drier conditions worry Cromwell Purchase because of their potential impact on habitat for the few surviving Spix’s macaws.\"A dry area only gets rain for a very short period of the year. A drought in that period might go an entire year before you’re going to get your next rain,\" said Purchase, a tall and slim 46-year-old. \"The animals are adapted to harsh environments, but they are on the edge. Any small increment of change will decimate populations.\"In November, two federal research institutes released a study of rainfall water loss in plants and soil between 1960 and 2020. It showed that northern Bahia state, including Curaca, where the Spix’s macaws are trying to survive, is now consistent with a desert area. It also identified the expansion of semi-arid climate in the Northeast, where nearly 55 million people live.LESSER-KNOWN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE US THREATENED BY FUNDING DISPARITIES\"If the planet is warmer, there will be much greater evaporation. So, the water leaves the environment and generates aridity,\" the director of Brazil’s anti-desertification efforts, Alexandre Pires, told The Associated Press.Since 2005, semi-arid area in Brazil has expanded by 116,000 square miles and is now roughly the size of three Californias. The government is set to announce measures to avoid desertification by promoting better management of soil and other natural resources in the region.In the face of the changing climate and numerous challenges, at every turn the Purchases have dedicated the better part of their adult lives to breeding Spix\\'s macaws and reintroducing them into nature. The journey first took the biologists to work with a private collection on an oasis in Qatar. When the birds were sold to a nonprofit organization, the couple moved with them to Germany.Over the past four years, their efforts have been centered in the rural area of Curaca, a nondescript town of 34,000 people.Under an agreement between the Brazilian government and the German nonprofit Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, 52 Spix’s macaws were sent in 2020 to Brazil on two charter flights. Federal police escorted them to breeding and reintroduction facilities accessible by a 1-hour drive on a rough dirt road, where the Purchases live and work for the nonprofit.The following year, 20 Spix’s macaws were released in the wild, along with 15 wild-sourced Blue-Winged macaws, whose purpose was to \"teach\" them how to fly, avoid risks and forage. Last year, two Spix’s macaw chicks were born in freedom — the first ones in decades— but they didn\\'t survive.All released birds were equipped with radio collars designed to resist macaws’ strong bills. Each collar has an antenna. The Purchases and their assistant check the birds\\' locations three times a day.Half of the Spix’s macaws have died, mostly from predation, or disappeared. Now, the remaining ones live within 3 miles of the facilities, a compound that includes the couple’s house and a U-shaped flight-and-release cage that\\'s 51 yards long.In March, three more of the light pale blue chicks were born in the wild. Not only did they survive, but one of them also flew for the first time last week, a major breakthrough.\"This event is so important as it shows how comfortable the parents are in their wild environment,\" Candice Purchase said in a text message. \"A remarkable achievement for the birds and an incredible success for the release.\"US GOVERNMENT DECLARES RARE LIZARD ENDANGERED, SPARKING CLASH BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND OIL INDUSTRYTo mitigate the impacts of desertification, the German parrot nonprofit partnered with a private company, Blue Sky Caatinga, to promote reforestation of 59,300 acres in the territory of Spix’s macaw. This initiative involves engaging small farmers who heavily depend on goat raising.Unlike depictions in the animated films \"Rio\" and \"Rio 2,\" which brought attention to the Spix’s macaw extinction threat, the parrot’s natural habitat is far from Brazil’s most famous city, Rio de Janeiro, and the Amazon rainforest. It lives among the sparse, thorny, low caatinga vegetation that often loses greenery during dry periods. And the bird uses the Caraibeira, a towering evergreen tree that grows near small intermittent creeks, for nesting and food. During breeding season, the trees allow the pairs to conserve energy and avoid flying long distances to feed.When the macaws first arrived from Germany, they were offered various foods from the wild. \"We found that it took a while for the birds to recognize them as food,\" Purchase said. \"But the Caraibeira tree produces a seed pod, almost like helicopter seeds. The Spix’s had never seen anything like it before. We put those in the cages and some picked them up and immediately knew how to open them and eat the kernel inside, which was totally remarkable and took us by surprise.\"The project also faces challenges outside the natural world. On May 15, the federal government informed the nonprofit that it would terminate the agreement, which expires on June 5. In a statement to the AP, Brazil\\'s federal environmental agency said it discovered that, in 2023, the nonprofit transferred Spix’s macaws from its center in Germany to other countries without its consent. The agreement will not be renewed until the situation is clarified, but the government said the nonprofit can continue its reintroduction work. The project\\'s funding comes from international donors.The strained relations have put a pause on plans to release 20 parrots per year over 20 years. \"No release in 2023 and now looking like a 2024 release is unlikely. It would be a shame for the project to fail because of government politics,\" Purchase said.There are approximately 360 Spix’s macaws in captivity worldwide, with 46 in Curaca.Despite the hurdles, many residents of Curaca, even if they never have never seen a Spix\\'s macaw, expect them to soon return to flying over the region and not just be seen in countless paintings that made the parrot part of the city\\'s identity.\"The project is already a success. They are free,\" said Maria de Lourdes Oliveira, whose family leased part of their land for reforestation. \"The most difficult thing was to arrive in Brazil. I cried when I saw them going to freedom and flapping their wings.\"'}\n",

But only recently have they been able to kill the trees. Scientists say they recently discovered about 40 sequoia trees that have died from beetle infestations, mostly within the national parks.\"We’re documenting some trees that are actually dying from kind of a combination of drought and fire that have weakened them to a point where they’re not able to defend themselves from the beetle attack,\" Ambrose said.The beetles attack the trees from the canopy, boring into branches and working their way down the trunk. If left unchecked, the tiny beetles can kill a tree within six months.That’s why park officials allowed Ambrose and his colleagues to climb General Sherman. They conducted the tree health inspection as journalists and visitors watched them pull themselves up ropes dangling from the canopy. They examined the branches and trunk, looking for the tiny holes that indicate beetle activity.But it’s not possible to climb every sequoia tree to directly inspect the canopy in person. That’s why they’re also testing whether drones equipped with sensors and aided by satellite imagery can be used to monitor and detect beetle infestations on a larger scale within the forests.Tuesday’s health inspection of General Sherman was organized by the Giant Sequoia Lands Coalition, a group of government agencies, Native tribes and environmental groups. They hope to establish a health monitoring program for the towering trees.If they discover beetle infestations, officials say, they could try to combat the attacks by spraying water, removing branches or using chemical treatments.Bark beetles have ravaged pine and fir forests throughout the Western United States in recent years, but they previously didn’t pose a threat to giant sequoias, which can live 3,000 years.\"They have really withstood insect attacks for a lot of years. So why now? Why are we seeing this change?\" said Clay Jordan, superintendent for Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. \"There’s a lot that we need to learn in order to ensure good stewardship of these trees for a long time.\"'}\n",

Now, it has colorful competition.There’s a growing buzz around pink noise, brown noise, green noise — a rainbow of soothing sounds — and their theoretical effects on sleep, concentration and relaxation response.The science is new with only a few small studies behind it, but that hasn’t stopped thousands of people from listening to hours of these noises on YouTube and on meditation apps that provide a palette of color noises with paid subscriptions.IMPROVING MEMORY MAY BE AS EASY AS POPPING A MULTIVITAMIN, STUDY FINDS: ‘PREVENTS VASCULAR DEMENTIA\\'To understand pink noise, start with white, the most familiar of the color noises.White noise is similar to static on a radio or TV. Sound engineers define it as having equal volume across all the frequencies audible to the human ear. It gets its name from white light, which contains all the visible color wavelengths.But the high frequencies of white noise can sound harsh. Pink noise turns down the volume on those higher frequencies, so it sounds lower in pitch and more like the natural sound of rain or the ocean.Brown noise sounds even lower in pitch, giving it a pleasing, soothing rumble.Pink and brown, like white, have standard definitions to audio experts. Other color noises are more recent creations with very flexible definitions.White noise and pink noise may provide small benefits for people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, according to a recent review of limited ADHD studies. In theory, it wakes up the brain, said ADHD researcher and co-author Joel Nigg of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.\"The noise provides stimulation to the brain without providing information, and so it doesn’t distract,\" Nigg said.White noise has been used to treat ringing or buzzing in the ear, called tinnitus.Scientists at Northwestern University are studying how short pulses of pink noise can enhance the slow brain waves of deep sleep. In small studies, these pink-noise pulses have shown promise in improving memory and the relaxation response.Pink noise has a frequency profile \"very similar to the distribution of brain wave frequencies we see in slow-wave sleep because these are large, slow waves,\" said Dr. Roneil Malkani, assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.If Northwestern’s research pans out, it could lead to a medical device to improve sleep or memory through personalized pulses of pink noise. But many scientific questions remain unanswered, Malkani said. \"There’s still a lot of work we have to do.\"If color noises feel calming and help you drown out distractions, it makes sense to use them. Keep them at a quiet level, of course, to prevent hearing loss and take \"plenty of breaks for the ears to rest,\" Nigg said.'}\n",

They are also a\\xa0valuable food source for birds and mammals.\\xa0According to one social media video, turkeys have been feasting on cicadas.

They\\'re insects, so they have to shed their skin to get to the next stage, and they will go through their final molt where they pull out of their immature skin, and they will be in their adult skin, which will have wings,\" Benson said.\\xa0\"They’ll molt, expand their wings, harden up and when they\\'re ready they’ll fly up into the trees.\"He said that eventually the cicadas will mate in a noisy fashion and then the females will deposit their eggs onto tree branches. They will hatch and fall into the ground where they will stay for the next 13 or 17 years before the process repeats.\\xa0So many cicadas will make noise at once in some places that sound levels might reach upward of 90 to 120 decibels, equivalent to a gas-powered lawnmower or motorcycle, the U.S. Forest Service says.\\xa0Meanwhile, the mating cicadas will die off and homeowners will be left hoping that the dead carcasses do not land in their gardens as they can smell badly if they die in large numbers together.Females\\xa0laying their eggs on small tree branches can harm young trees and the EPA advises covering maturing saplings in mesh or netting to keep the insects out.Experts also advise homeowners to cover pools, patio furniture or similar items from cicada or their droppings when they are active.Brood XIII cicadas appear on a 17-year cycle, and are restricted mostly to northern Illinois, eastern Iowa, southern Wisconsin and a few counties in extreme northwestern Indiana, according to entomologist Floyd Shockley of the Smithsonian Institution\\'s National Museum of Natural History in Washington.\\xa0Brood XIX emerges on a slightly shorter 13-year cycle, and are widely distributed from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia - a total of 15 states, according to Shockley.

But even if it involves time behind bars, that doesn\\'t mean his campaign to return to the White House comes to an end.He wouldn\\'t even be the first candidate to run for that office while imprisoned. That piece of history belongs to Eugene V. Debs, who ran on the Socialist Party ticket in 1920 — and garnered almost a million votes, or about 3 percent.AMERICANS MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD ON THE TRUMP VERDICTThe circumstances are obviously different. Debs, despite his influence and fame, was effectively a fringe candidate that year; Trump has already held the office and is running as the near-certain nominee of one of the country\\'s two major political parties. But there are similarities, too.Debs, born in 1855, became a strong voice advocating for labor causes from the time he was a young man. A staunch union member and leader, he was first sent to prison for six months following the 1894 Pullman rail strike, on grounds he violated a federal injunction against the strike.He became a committed socialist, and a founding member of the Socialist Party of America. He ran for president as a socialist in 1900, 1904, 1908 and 1912.In 1918, though, he was sent to prison for speaking out against American involvement in World War I, which was a violation of the recently passed Sedition Act. But being locked up in a federal prison in Atlanta didn\\'t lower Debs\\' profile at all, and in 1920, he was once again nominated as the party\\'s presidential candidate.Being in prison didn\\'t make campaigning impossible, either. While Debs obviously could not travel around the country himself, his party turned his status into a rallying point, using his convict number on campaign buttons. Surrogates spoke for him, as well as a film clip of him being told of his nomination that played around the country, said Thomas Doherty, professor of American Studies at Brandeis University.\"The fame of Debs and the novelty of him running for president from prison gave him a sort of purchase,\" Doherty said. \"It was a credible campaign, considering you\\'re running from prison.\"'}\n",

The wording suggests the company didn’t have direct access to the leaked database. Still, the post revealed plenty of information about the incident and the threat actors behind the attack.The hacking groups EquationCorp and USDoD are reportedly responsible for a major data breach involving the criminal record database. The breach, which resulted in the online leak of the database, contains 70 million entries. It includes the full names, dates of birth, known aliases, addresses, arrest and conviction dates, sentences and other information of millions of Americans who had encounters with the U.S. justice system between 2020 and 2024.We contacted Malwarebytes and spoke with Pieter Arntz, a security researcher at the company, who informed us that they were able to obtain a small sample of the criminal records, which are specific to individual incidents. Each entry represents either an arrest or a case rather than a comprehensive compilation of all crimes committed by a single person. In other words, these records provide a snapshot of discrete legal events rather than a comprehensive overview of an individual’s criminal history.\\xa0The exact source of this database is unknown. However, the hacker group USDoD, a major player in the field, is closely linked to \"Pompompurin,\" the operator of the original data leak site BreachForums. According to Malwarebytes, USDoD plans to create a successor to the second version of BreachForums, which was recently shut down by law enforcement. By releasing this database, USDoD might be trying to attract new users.The same hacker is also believed to be involved in a breach at TransUnion, the data from which was partly dumped in September 2023.MASSIVE DELL DATA BREACH HITS 49 MILLION USERS — WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR PRIVACY AND SECURITYIf you\\'ve had a run-in with the law before, there\\'s a good chance that a bunch of the info you shared with law enforcement is now out there on the web. The exposure of such a comprehensive criminal database could have significant implications for law enforcement, judicial proceedings and the individuals mentioned within the dataset.The hackers who pulled off the leak might be looking to make a quick buck by selling your data to shady characters on the dark web. They might also try to con you by pretending to be someone you trust or a legit company, aiming to get their hands on some cash.This much bulk data can also be used by bad actors to threaten, harass and blackmail people with records similar to the Ashley Madison breach. For the unaware, In July 2015, a hacker group calling itself \"The Impact Team\" stole the user data of Ashley Madison, a commercial website billed as enabling extramarital affairs. These hackers copied personal information from the user base and threatened to expose users\\' names and personal details unless Ashley Madison shut down right away.WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?SNEAKY SPYWARE IS AFTER YOUR MOST SENSITIVE DATAIf you suspect you\\'ve been impacted by this data breach, follow these steps to protect your personal data and privacy.1. Invest in identity theft protection: If you think your personal data has been leaked, scammers may try to impersonate you to gain access to your private information. The best thing you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service.Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.\\xa02. Place a fraud alert: Contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.\\xa0GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE3.

Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request.The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.\\xa04. Check Social Security benefits: It is crucial to periodically check your Social Security benefits to ensure they have not been tampered with or altered in any way, safeguarding your financial security and preventing potential fraud.\\xa05. Invest in removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for removal services here.6. Change your password: You can render a stolen password useless to thieves simply by changing it. Opt for a strong password — one you don\\'t use elsewhere. Even better, consider letting a password manager generate one for you.AT&T DATA LEAK FROM 73 MILLION CUSTOMERS — WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NEXTThe fact that threat actors were able to leak such a comprehensive amount of data suggests serious loopholes in government systems.

Invoices, for better or worse, come regularly and on a consistent schedule. If something shows up in an unusual form (an email instead of a letter in the mail per usual) or at a particular time, you are more likely to stop yourself from falling for this type of scam.Go to the official website for contact information. If the scammers happen to pick a company that you do subscribe to, it can be even easier to fall for this type of scam. But before clicking any links, downloading any invoices or calling the number listed, you can google the company’s official website and use the contact information there. If the company did indeed send you a bill, they should be able to help you with the refund or confirm whether you were sent legitimate communications.Watch for language and tone of voice: Most legitimate companies go out of their way to specially train their employees to provide their customers with excellent service. They are trained not to lose their temper, so if you happen to be on a call with a scammer, they often don’t use professional language or have a professional demeanor. If you push back on providing certain information, a real customer service agent wouldn’t make any threats or demands. Providing Social Security numbers or bank account information is usually frowned upon for security reasons by legitimate companies. Legitimate companies typically have other ways to validate your identity and account information. You can always hang up the phone if you get overwhelmed on a call! After all, an honest company doesn’t disappear after one disconnection.\\xa0Setup payments electronically: If you have your subscriptions paid electronically on a regular basis, you’ll know that you shouldn’t be receiving an additional invoice for a subscription service. Additionally, if you are paying with a credit card, you can try to use a specific card for all your subscriptions so you know where and when to expect the charges. You’ll also know that certain bank information shouldn’t be relevant to paying an invoice if you get one of these phishing emails.

Change passwords: For any accounts that might have been accessed or mentioned to or by the scammer, you should log in from a secure, virus- and malware-free device and change your password immediately. It is best to create unique and complex passwords, including letters, symbols and numbers, for each separate online account. If you need help generating and storing complex passwords, consider using a password manager.2. Keep an eye on all your accounts and credit consistently: Contact the financial institution and explain the situation for all accounts impacted by the potential scammer. They can help you freeze or lock your account, so these scammers have little or no access to your money. Contact the three main credit bureaus to freeze your credit. This will prevent anyone, including hackers, from wreaking havoc on your credit. Make sure to report any errors on your credit reports with the credit agencies. Remember that you are allowed a free annual credit report. If there are too many accounts for you to keep track of regularly, a credit monitoring service can help by constantly monitoring and alerting you of any account changes or problems.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE3. Setup alerts for financial accounts: Most financial institutions offer financial alerts or restrictions for all transactions for checking accounts and cards. Do use them so you can be notified of any fraudulent transactions immediately. The faster you can report these charges to your financial institution, the more likely you can stop the scammers in their tracks.4. Enable two-factor authentication for any account impacted by the phishing scam: This would include your financial accounts and email address. If you have this additional layer of security on, the hacker or scammer would have to send a code to another device or account to gain access, even with your password.\\xa05. Get Identity Theft Protection: While getting an identity theft service seems overkill, many identity theft protection services can help you when your accounts get compromised. They continually monitor the dark web and your financial accounts to see if any crucial personal information like your email addresses or bank account information is compromised or up for sale on the dark web. Getting those alerts immediately allows you to act faster and take the above-mentioned steps.\\xa0If you have already given out your information to a potential scammer, you should follow these steps to ensure that your identity hasn’t been stolen.

One of them, called KP.2, has become the most commonly circulating variant in the United States over the past month, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Here is what you need to know about FLiRT.GREG GUTFELD: MARIANNETTE MILLER-MEEKS \\'MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY\\' TO GRILL COVID ERA OFFICIAL ON THE LIVES RUINEDThe FLiRT variants, which also include KP.2\\'s \"parental\" lineage JN.1, have three key mutations on their spike protein that could help them evade antibodies, according to Johns Hopkins University.Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital in Oceanside, New York, and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America said he has not seen evidence of an uptick in disease or hospitalizations, based on the data he tracks and experience with his own patients.\"There have been some significant changes in the variants, but I think in recent times it\\'s not been as important, probably because of the immunity many, many people already have\" from prior illness and vaccination.CDC data suggests that COVID-related hospitalizations have trended downwards in recent weeks and the number of patients in emergency departments who have tested positive for COVID has been about flat for the past month.Data suggests that COVID rates are also down year-over-year. The rate of COVID hospitalizations is less than half than a year earlier, and the amount of the antiviral Paxlovid currently being prescribed for COVID-19 is down around 60% from last year, according to analyst notes.The current vaccines should still have some benefit against the new variants, Glatt said.Since 2022, health regulators have asked vaccine makers to design new versions of the COVID-19 vaccines to better target circulating variants. Last month, Europe\\'s regulator said vaccine makers should target the JN.1 variant. U.S. experts and regulators will meet to discuss vaccine design on June 5 after having postponed the meeting from May 16 in order to have more time to \"obtain surveillance data and other information.\"Makers of vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology - Pfizer with partner BioNTech, and Moderna - say they are waiting for the June 5 meeting before settling on the design of their next vaccines.Novavax, which makes a more traditional protein-based vaccine that takes longer to manufacture, has begun producing a shot targeting JN.1 consistent with recommendations from European regulators.'}\n",

Lobby group the National Milk Producers Federation said it encouraged farms to use protective equipment in line with federal recommendations and heard of increased worker protections.Three dairy workers, seven activists and two lawyers who assist farm employees told Reuters that dairy owners have not offered equipment like face shields and goggles to staff who spend 10- to 12-hour days side-by-side with cows. Three large dairy companies with tens of thousands of cows declined to comment on their procedures.The workers - all based in New York, a major dairy producer - said they heard of the new illness affecting cattle through the media or community organizers, not their employers. One, 39-year-old Luis Jimenez from Mexico, said last week it was business as usual.\"They\\'re not doing anything,\" he said.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April and May advised workers to use personal protective equipment (PPE) if they may be exposed to sick livestock, after a Texas dairy worker tested positive for bird flu. On May 6, the agency asked states to make equipment available to workers.CDC wants \"to make sure that farm workers across the country, whether they are at a farm with an affected herd or not, have access to PPE,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, last week.New York state said it is assessing CDC\\'s recommendation and has not yet distributed equipment. Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, where cattle were infected, said they distributed equipment to eight dairies combined. Kansas, Idaho and Wisconsin said they have equipment, but no farmers asked for it.Michigan, where the second dairy worker tested positive, said many farms have protective gear but the state is coordinating a way to make it available for those that need more.Dairies became more aware of bird flu\\'s risks in late April after the U.S. government began requiring that cows test negative before crossing state lines, said Emily Yeiser Stepp, who oversees a National Milk Producers Federation program that covers workforce development.Still, \"reaching out into some of our rural networks takes a little longer,\" she said when told of workers who said they were not informed of recommendations for protective equipment.The U.S. confirmed bird flu in dairy cattle in nine states. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on findings of H5N1 particles in about 20% of retail milk samples.Bird flu has caused serious or fatal infections globally among people in close contact with wild birds or poultry. In cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads.Health experts advise dairy workers to wear gloves and disposable coveralls that can block milk splashes on their bodies or clothing.Jimenez said his coworkers are under pressure to work so quickly that they sometimes do not have time to wash their hands before meals and often drive home in their work clothes.Workers attach and detach milking equipment on cows, putting their faces close to unpasteurized milk. Most are immigrants and many do not have health insurance.\"When you\\'re milking, splashes can\\'t be avoided. When it splashes in our eyes, we wash it out with water,\" said another New York worker, who requested anonymity because he is undocumented.Lucas Sjostrom, a farmer and executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association, uses robotic machines to attach milking equipment to cows, but said he is being extra conscious that human workers wear gloves while transporting unpasteurized milk. Minnesota has not reported bird flu in cows.In Indiana, another state without confirmed cases, farmer Steve Obert said he has not increased precautions for workers, though that could change if his herd tests positive. Extra protective equipment is not comfortable to wear, he added.\"We\\'re rather isolated and I don\\'t think the risk is really great,\" said Obert, executive director of the industry group Indiana Dairy Producers.The infected Texas worker suffered conjunctivitis and broken blood vessels that turned his eyes scarlet red, according to a photo published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He reported wearing gloves when working with cows but not respiratory or eye protection, the journal said.Scientists are watching for changes in the virus that could make it spread more easily among humans. Epidemiologists said it could cause more serious illnesses if it mutates or infects someone with a compromised immune system.Some dairies with infected cows have resisted allowing federal officials on their farms because of financial concerns, said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases.The CDC said it would like to test more farm workers, but it is not required.New Mexico had anecdotal reports of workers with symptoms similar to conjunctivitis, but most were not tested, according to internal state documents that were dated April 26 and obtained by Reuters under a public records request. The workers were not tested because they did not seek healthcare, the New Mexico Department of Health said.Policy changes are needed to encourage workers to seek treatment, such as emergency income assurance for those who test positive, said Brian Castrucci, an epidemiologist and CEO at health policy group the de Beaumont Foundation.\"I don\\'t want to wait until we have a dead dairy farm worker until we ratchet up what we\\'re doing,\" he said.'}\n",

It has described the planned polls as a threat to the territorial integrity of both Syria and Turkey.\"We are closely following the aggressive actions by the terrorist organization against the territorial integrity of our country and of Syria under the pretext of an election,\" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday.Turkey considers the Kurdish militia group, known as the People’s Protection Units, as a terrorist group linked to an outlawed Kurdish group that has led an insurgency in Turkey since 1984.

The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events \"to die and become a martyr,\" the statement also said.France is on in its highest security alert ahead of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which are expected to draw millions of visitors, and run July 26-Aug. 11. Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris’ Stade de France.Darmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but has said there are multiple potential threats, including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries.The Paris Olympics organizing committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services. ‘’Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders — and will continue to be fully mobilized,\\'\\' it said in a statement.Security concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony, which brings more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments.In April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country’s national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high.Organizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000.The French government also decided that tourists won’t be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead.Extra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily.'}\n",

Conducted by the agency\\'s Economist Impact Unit, the study comes as Pakistan is experiencing an intense heatwave that has sickened thousands of people, further burdening the country\\'s health care system.28 CONFIRMED DEAD IN PAKISTAN AFTER BUS PLUNGES INTO ROCKY RAVINETemperatures in various parts of Pakistan soared as high as 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) Friday.Authorities were also battling forest fires, which Pakistan has been experiencing during heatwaves in recent years. Near the capital, Islamabad, a fire broke out on Thursday but officials have yet to determine whether it was caused by the high temperatures.Plumes of smoke were seen rising from the hills around Islamabad as firefighting helicopters flew overhead to douse the flames.Amid soaring temperatures, authorities urged people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.\"Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,\" said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.\"Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,\" Fadil said. \"We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough.

That\\'s nearing the record of 65.7% in 2017, when from 2009 to 2017 about one-seventh of the world\\'s coral died, said Derek Manzello, coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coral Reef Watch Program.When water gets too hot, coral, which are living creatures, bleach and sometimes die.CORAL REEFS AROUND THE WORLD ARE EXPERIENCING MASS BLEACHING IN WARMING OCEANS, SCIENTISTS SAYIn the Atlantic, off the Florida coast and in the Caribbean, about 99.7% of the coral reefs have been hit with \"very very severe\\'\\' losses in staghorn and elkhorn species, Manzello said Thursday in NOAA\\'s monthly climate briefing. Sixty-two countries are seeing damaged coral, with Thailand shutting off a tourist-laden island to try to save the coral there.Meteorologists say a La Nina — a natural cooling of parts of the Pacific that changes the weather worldwide — is forecast to develop soon and perhaps cool oceans a bit, but Manzello said it may be too little and too late.\"I still am very worried about the state of the world\\'s coral reefs just because we\\'re seeing things play out right now that are just very unexpected and extreme,\" Manzello said.\"This wouldn\\'t be happening without climate change.

It was the 13th straight month global seas broke records, and because the oceans are slow to cool or warm, more records are likely, said Karin Gleason, NOAA\\'s climate monitoring chief.Coral reefs are key to seafood production and tourism worldwide.

Then research suggested that some could control their body temperature, but when and how that shift came about remained a mystery.Now, a new study estimates that the first warm-blooded dinosaurs may have roamed the Earth about 180 million years ago, about halfway through the creatures’ time on the planet.Warm-blooded creatures — including birds, who are descended from dinosaurs, and humans — keep their body temperature constant whether the world around them runs cold or hot. Cold-blooded animals, including reptiles like snakes and lizards, depend on outside sources to control their temperature: For example, basking in the sun to warm up.NEW MEXICO STUDY SHOWS NEWLY DISCOVERED DINOSAUR SUBSPECIES PREDATES TYRANNOSAURUS REXKnowing when dinosaurs evolved their stable internal thermometer could help scientists answer other questions about how they lived, including how active and social they were.To estimate the origin of the first warm-blooded dinosaurs, researchers analyzed over 1,000 fossils, climate models and dinosaurs’ family trees. They found that two major groups of dinosaurs — which include Tyrannosaurus rex, velociraptors and relatives of triceratops — migrated to chillier areas during the Early Jurassic period, indicating they may have developed the ability to stay warm. A third crop of dinosaurs, which includes brontosaurs, stuck to warmer areas.\"If something is capable of living in the Arctic, or very cold regions, it must have some way of heating up,\" said Alfio Allesandro Chiarenza, a study author and a postdoctoral fellow at University College London.The research was published Wednesday in the journal Current Biology.Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral fellow at the Field Museum in Chicago, said a dinosaur’s location is not the only way to determine whether it is warm-blooded. Research by Wiemann, who was not involved with the latest study, suggests that warm-blooded dinosaurs may have evolved closer to the beginning of their time on Earth, around 250 million years ago.She said compiling clues from multiple aspects of dinosaurs’ lives — including their body temperatures and diets — may help scientists paint a clearer picture of when they evolved to be warm-blooded.'}\n",

As we know exactly where they’re coming from, they have the potential to be placed back into the wild. … So it is very important to keep these corals, as it’s going not very well in the wild,\" Nienke Klerks, a biologist at the Royal Burgers’ Zoo in Arnhem, told The Associated Press.DEEP-SEA DISCOVERY: ANCIENT CORAL MAY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST GLOW-IN-THE-DARK CREATURES, STUDY FINDSIt’s among several projects worldwide seeking to address the decline of coral reef populations, which are suffering from bleaching caused by rising sea temperatures. Corals are central to marine ecosystems, and while these projects won’t stem the tide of damage from human-caused climate change, they are seen as part of broader solutions.The World Coral Conservatory hopes to create a bank of corals in aquariums across Europe that could be used to repopulate wild coral reefs if they succumb to the stress of climate change or pollution.Along with two zoos in France and the originator of the project — the Monaco Scientific Center — the zoo in the east of the Netherlands took in more than a dozen coral fragments from off the coast of Seychelles in east Africa.The Dutch zoo has been propagating the corals since 2022, allowing them to grow in a highly regulated environment before they were large enough to join the rest of the reef.CORAL REEFS AROUND THE WORLD ARE EXPERIENCING MASS BLEACHING IN WARMING OCEANS, SCIENTISTS SAY\"We test it behind the scenes … what works for these corals. In that way, we know where to place them and how to keep them,\" zookeeper Pascal Kik said.Each diver held up a coral — one that resembled a large mushroom, the other a decorative cookie — to be photographed by reporters before placing them on a ledge near the center of the 8-million-liter (2.1-million-gallon) tank.Few of the other corals at the zoo come from the wild. They are either shared by other zoos or turned over by Dutch customs officers after being confiscated. Coral poaching is a major threat to coral reefs in parts of Asia.That would make it difficult to return the corals to the wild. But the team knows exactly where their 14 corals came from, making it more likely they could be successfully reintroduced if needed.Corals area keystone marine species, according to Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society. Eakin, retired coral monitoring chief at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that around 25% of marine animals spend some part of their lives dependent on coral reefs.That makes projects such as the one in Arnhem all the more important to pursue, he said.\"We are in a situation where we really need to be taking any possible action we can,\" Eakin told AP.Earlier in April, scientists from the NOAA and International Coral Reef Initiative said that coral reefs around the world are experiencing global bleaching for the fourth time.Bleaching occurs when coral under stress expels the algae that gives them their vibrant colors. The algae is also a coral’s food source, and if the bleaching lasts for too long or is too severe, the coral could die.In the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, bleaching affected 90% of the coral assessed in 2022. The Florida Coral Reef, the third-largest, experienced significant bleaching last year.Terry Hughes of Australia’s James Cook University, an expert on the Great Barrier Reef, argues that the world needs faster, bolder efforts to stop the damage from climate change, instead of small-scale restoration projects like this one.\"You can’t replace a magnificent ecosystem with an aquarium,\" he said.Others say every little bit helps.\"Coral reefs would be one of the first systems to totally collapse due to climate change,’’ said Ronald Osinga, a marine biologist who specializes in corals at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.\"It’s sad that it has to be like this,\" said Osinga, who is not involved in the Dutch zoo initiative. But projects like this are a \"good backup plan.\"'}\n",

They also said the most important aspect of the galaxy was how luminous the galaxy was from such a far distance.The galaxy is estimated to be more than 1,600 light years across, and the light is suspected to be coming from young stars and not emission from a growing supermassive black hole.WITNESS THE MESMERIZING CONJUNCTION OF THE MOON AND VENUS IN SPACEThe starlight also implies the galaxy is several hundreds of millions of times the mass of the Sun, the astronomers claim, leading to more mysteries of how it can make such a bright and massive galaxy in less than 300 million years.The astronomers learned through the data that the color of the galaxy was reddened by dust and was not as blue as it could be in early phases of the galaxy.Wavelengths of light collected by Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) indicated the brightness of the source was above what would be extrapolated from the measurements of other instruments on the telescope, suggesting the presence of ionized gas emission from hydrogen and oxygen.They say oxygen being present at such an early stage suggests multiple generations of massive stars already lived their lives before the telescope was able to observe the galaxy, the astronomers said.\"All of these observations, together, tell us that JADES-GS-z14-0 is not like the types of galaxies that have been predicted by theoretical models and computer simulations to exist in the very early universe,\" the astronomers said in the press release. \"Given the observed brightness of the source, we can forecast how it might grow over cosmic time, and so far, we have not found any suitable analogs from the hundreds of other galaxies we’ve observed at high redshift in our survey.\\xa0\"It is likely that astronomers will find many such luminous galaxies, possibly at even earlier times, over the next decade with Webb,\" the team added. \"We’re thrilled to see the extraordinary diversity of galaxies that existed at Cosmic Dawn!\"The findings are still being studied and have not been through the peer-review process, according to NASA.The Webb Telescope, the successor to the Hubble and the largest telescope ever launched into space, is a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency.\\xa0'}\n",

The finding could help predict periods of solar storms.\", 'content': 'New research indicates the sun’s magnetic field originates much closer to the surface than previously thought, a finding that could help predict periods of extreme solar storms like the ones that slammed Earth earlier this month.The magnetic field appears to generate 20,000 miles beneath the sun’s surface. Previous calculations put the roots of this process more than 130,000 miles below, an international team reported Wednesday.The sun’s intense magnetic energy is the source of solar flares and eruptions of plasma known as coronal mass ejections. When directed toward Earth, they can create stunning auroras but also disrupt power and communications.EARTH IN THE CLEAR AFTER SUN EMITS LARGEST SOLAR FLARE IN NEARLY 10-YEAR CYCLE\"We still don’t understand the sun well enough to make accurate predictions\" of space weather, lead author Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh said in an email.The latest findings published in the journal Nature \"will be an important step toward finally resolving\" this mysterious process known as solar dynamo, added co-author Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University.Galileo was among the first astronomers to turn a telescope skyward and study sunspots, back in the early 1600s. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur near sunspots, dark patches as big as Earth that are located near the most intense portions of the sun’s shifting magnetic field.Vasil and his team developed new models of the interaction between the sun’s magnetic field and the flow of plasma, which varies at different latitudes during an 11-year cycle. They fed their calculations into a NASA supercomputer in Northern California — the same one used in the 2015 movie \"The Martian\" to verify the best flight path to rescue the main character. The results suggested a shallow magnetic field and additional research is needed to confirm this.The modeling was \"highly simplified,\" University of Wisconsin-Madison\\'s Ellen Zweibel, who was not part of the team, said in an accompanying editorial.The results are intriguing and \"sure to inspire future studies,\" Zweibel said.The new knowledge should improve long-term solar forecasts, allowing scientists to better predict the strength of our star\\'s future cycles. The sun is approaching its peak level of activity in the current 11-year cycle, thus the recent flareups.Strong solar flares and outbursts of billions of tons of plasma earlier this month unleashed severe solar storms that produced auroras in unexpected places. Last week, the sun spewed out the biggest solar flare in almost 20 years, but it steered clear of Earth.Better understanding of the sun can ensure \"we are prepared for when the next storm — potentially much more dangerous — hits Earth,\" Lecoanet said.'}\n",

This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them — the end of a \"shooting star.\"The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.It’s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.The Southern Hemisphere will have the best view of Eta Aquarids, but a waning moon just 14% full will allow for clear viewing in both hemispheres, according to the American Meteor Society.The meteor society keeps an updated list of upcoming large meteor showers, including the peak viewing days and moonlight conditions.The next big one is the Southern Delta Aquarid meteor shower, which peaks in late July.'}\n",

China has its own space station and conceptual plans for a moon base.\", 'content': 'China on Friday launched a lunar probe to land on the far side of the moon and return with samples that could provide insights into differences between the less-explored region and the better-known near side.It is the latest advance in China’s increasingly sophisticated space exploration program, which is now competing with the U.S., still the leader in space.China also has a three-member crew on its own orbiting space station and aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2030. Three Chinese lunar probe missions are planned over the next four years.JAPAN\\'S MOON LANDER HAS SURVIVED LONGER THAN THE SPACE AGENCY EXPECTED AFTER REACHING 3 MONTHS ON THE MOONFree from exposure to Earth and other interference, the moon’s somewhat mysterious far side is ideal for radio astronomy and other scientific work. Because the far side never faces Earth, a relay satellite is needed to maintain communications.The rocket carrying the Chang’e-6 lunar probe — named after the Chinese mythical moon goddess — lifted off Friday at 5:27 p.m. as planned from the Wenchang launch center on the island province of Hainan. About 35 minutes later it separated entirely from the massive Long March-5 rocket — China\\'s largest — that had slung it into space, as technicians monitoring the launch from ground control smiled and applauded.Shortly afterward, launch mission commander Zhang Zuosheng took to a podium at the front of the room and said the launch had gone off exactly as planned and the spacecraft was on its set trajectory. \"I declare this launch mission a complete success,\" Zhang said to further applause.The Philippine Space Agency issued a statement saying expected debris from the rocket launch was \"projected to have fallen within the identified drop zones.\"China in 2021 was forced to defend its handling of a rocket booster that burned up over the Indian Ocean after the administrator of the American space agency and others accused Beijing of acting recklessly by allowing its rocket to fall to Earth seemingly uncontrolled after the mission.Huge numbers of people crowded Hainan\\'s beaches to view the launch, which comes in the middle of China’s five-day May Day holiday. As with previous recent launches, the event was televised live by state broadcaster CCTV.After orbiting the moon to reduce speed, the lander will separate from the spacecraft and within 48 hours of setting down it will begin drilling into the lunar surface and scooping up samples with its robotic arm. With the samples sealed in a container, it will then reconnect with the returner for the trip back to Earth. The entire mission is set to last 53 days.China in 2020 returned samples from the moon\\'s near side, the first time anyone has done so since the U.S. Apollo program that ended in the 1970s. Analysis of the samples found they contained water in tiny beads embedded in lunar dirt.APRIL’S PINK MOON CAPTURED ON FULL DISPLAY OVER CHESAPEAKE BAYAlso in the past week, three Chinese astronauts returned home from a six-month mission on the country\\'s orbiting space station after the arrival of its replacement crew.China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely because of U.S. concerns over the Chinese military’s total control of the space program amid a sharpening competition in technology between the two geopolitical rivals. U.S. law bars almost all cooperation between the U.S. and Chinese space programs without explicit congressional approval.Faced with such limitations, China has expanded cooperation with other countries and agencies. The latest mission carries scientific instruments from France, Italy and the European Space Agency in cooperation with Sweden. A small Pakistani satellite is also on board.China’s ambitious space program aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2030, as well as bring back samples from Mars around the same year and launch three lunar probe missions over the next four years. The next is scheduled for 2027.Longer-term plans call for a permanent crewed base on the lunar surface, although those appear to remain in the conceptual phase.China conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, becoming the third country after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space using its own resources.The three-module Tiangong, much smaller than the ISS, was launched in 2021 and completed 18 months later. It can accommodate up to six astronauts at a time and is mainly dedicated to scientific research. The crew will also install space debris protection equipment, carry out payload experiments, and beam science classes to students on Earth.China has also said that it eventually plans to offer access to its space station to foreign astronauts and space tourists. With the ISS nearing the end of its useful life, China could eventually be the only country or corporation to maintain a crewed station in orbit.The U.S. space program is believed to still hold a significant edge over China’s due to its spending, supply chains and capabilities.The U.S. aims to put a crew back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025 as part of a renewed commitment to crewed missions, aided by private sector players such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. They plan to land on the moon\\'s south pole where permanently shadowed craters are believed to be packed with frozen water.'}\n",

So, engineers divided the affected code into sections and planned to move them to various locations in the FDS.NASA PUBLISHES NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN PHOTOS OF ‘RAVIOLI’ MOON ORBITING SATURNEngineers also had to make sure the code worked together as a whole after being moved.Once the code was reconfigured, engineers transmitted the changes to the FDS memory on April 18.The signal takes about 22.5 hours to travel through space until it reaches Voyager 1, and then another 22.5 hours for a signal to come back to earth.VOYAGER 1 DETECTS ‘HUM’ WHILE IN INTERSTELLAR SPACE: REPORTOn April 20, the mission team received a response from Voyager 1 and confirmed the modification worked. As a result, engineers now have the ability to check the health and status of the spacecraft.In the coming months, the team plans to move and adjust additional portions of the FDS software that was affected, including portions that send scientific data back to mission control.Voyager 1′s odyssey began in 1977 when the spacecraft and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched on a tour of the gas giant planets of the solar system.After beaming back dazzling postcard views of Jupiter’s giant red spot and Saturn’s shimmering rings, Voyager 2 hopscotched to Uranus and Neptune.

Various factors can impact your iPhone’s battery life quality and quantity.\"Hi, if your iPhone is plugged in and finishes charging, does it damage [the] phone or charger if it is left plugged in at 100% during the night? Also, does leaving the charger plugged in when not in use hurt the charger? Thank you.\" — Gail, Clifton, NJThe short answer to your question is, \"Yes,\" Gail. While it may not damage your iPhone, it can impact the lifespan of your phone’s battery. Leaving your phone plugged in overnight is not a bad idea, as phones are smart enough to prevent an overload. Charging stops once the internal lithium-ion battery hits 100% of its capacity. However, if you leave your phone plugged in overnight, it will use a bit of energy by constantly trickling new juice into the battery every time it falls to 99%. That is eating into your phone’s lifespan.As for your second question, leaving your charger plugged in when not in use does not damage it. The charger will only draw power when connected to a device that needs charging, so you can leave it plugged in without worrying about damaging it.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE NEWSLETTER, THE CYBERGUY REPORTMost modern mobile phones are powered by lithium batteries, which are lighter, last longer, charge faster and have more power density. Battery life depends on its chemical age, based on its temperature and charge history. As the battery life chemically ages, the amount of charge the battery can hold is reduced.

He was 74.The Correctional Service of Canada said in statement that Pickton, an inmate of Port-Cartier Institution in the province of Quebec, died in hospital following injuries in the May 19 assault involving another inmate. He was one of Canada’s most notorious serial killers and his case made international headlines.A CANADIAN SERIAL KILLER WHO BROUGHT VICTIMS TO A PIG FARM IS HOSPITALIZED AFTER A PRISON ASSAULTA 51-year-old inmate was in custody for the assault on Pickton, police spokesman Hugues Beaulieu said earlier this month.Robert \"Willie\" Pickton was convicted of six counts of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2007, with the maximum parole ineligibility period of 25 years, after being charged with the murders of 26 women.Police began searching the Pickton farm in the Vancouver suburb of Port Coquitlam more than 22 years ago in what would be a years-long investigation into the disappearances of dozens of women from Vancouver’s seediest streets, sex workers and drug addicts abandoned on the margins of society.The remains or DNA of 33 women were found on the farm. Pickton once bragged to an undercover police officer that he killed a total of 49 women.During his trial, prosecution witness Andrew Bellwood said Pickton told him how he strangled his victims and fed their remains to his pigs. Health officials once issued a tainted meat advisory to neighbors who might have bought pork from Pickton’s farm, concerned the meat might have contained human remains.Cynthia Cardinal, whose sister Georgina Papin was murdered by Pickton, said Pickton’s death means she can finally move on from her sister’s murder.\"This is gonna bring healing for, I won’t say all families, I’ll just say most of the families,\" she said. \"I’m like — wow, finally. I can actually move on and heal and I can put this behind me.\"Vancouver police were criticized for not taking the cases seriously because many of the missing were sex workers or drug users.Canada\\'s correctional service said it was conducting an investigation into the attack on Pickton.\"The investigation will examine all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the assault, including whether policies and protocols were followed,\" the service said in the statement. \"We are mindful that this offender’s case has had a devastating impact on communities in British Columbia and across the country, including Indigenous peoples, victims and their families. Our thoughts are with them.\"Pickton’s confirmed victims were six: Sereena Abotsway, Mona Wilson, Andrea Joesbury, Brenda Ann Wolfe, Papin and Marnie Frey.\"Earlier today, I was made aware of the death of an inmate at Port-Cartier Institution,\" Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in statement. \"At this time, my thoughts are with the families of the victims of this individual’s heinous crimes.\"At the time of Pickton’s sentencing, British Columbia Supreme Court Justice James Williams said it was a \"rare case that properly warrants the maximum period of parole ineligibility available to the court.\"'}\n",

Gangs in Mexico depend on controlling local police chiefs, and taking a share of municipal budgets; national politics appear to interest them less.ALMOST 2 MONTHS AFTER EMBASSY RAID, ECUADOR IS READY TO TALK WITH MEXICO AND REACH SOLUTIONBut in the runup to Sunday’s vote, gangs have increasingly taken to spraying whole campaign rallies with gunfire, burning ballots or preventing the setting up of polling stations — even putting up banners seeking to influence voters.Security analyst David Saucedo says it\\'s likely some drug gangs will try to force voters to cast ballots for their favored candidates.\"It it is reasonable to assume that the cartels will mobilize their support bases during Sunday\\'s elections,\" Saucedo said. \"They have loyal voters who they have won over through the distribution of food packages, cash, medicine and infrastructure projects. They will use them to support narco-candidates.\"In some places, it appears the gangs are encouraging people to vote while discouraging voting in areas controlled by their rivals.On Friday, electoral authorities reported that assailants burned a house where ballots were being stored ahead of Sunday in the violence-wracked town of Chicomuselo, in the southern state of Chiapas. While they did not say who was behind the attack, the town is completely dominated by two warring drug cartels, Jalisco and Sinaloa.On May 14, gunmen apparently linked to a cartel shot and killed 11 people in a single day in Chicomuselo. On May 17, five people were killed along with a mayoral candidate when gunmen opened fire on a crowd in the town of La Concordia, Chiapas, about 45 miles (75 kilometers) east of Chicomuselo.Targeted assassinations of local candidates continued. On Wednesday, dramatic video images showed a mayoral candidate in the southern state of Guerrero being shot in the head at point-blank rage with a pistol.And mass attacks on campaign rallies, once exceedingly rare in Mexico, are becoming common.Also on Wednesday, the last official day of campaigning, unidentified gunmen opened fire a couple of blocks away from a mayoral candidate\\'s final campaign rally in the western state of Michoacan, sending hundreds of people scrambling for safety.\"It seemed like a normal evening, like the campaign closers of other candidates,\" said Angélica Chávez, a homemaker who was at the rally in Cotija. \"Then there were gunshots, several rounds of gunfire very close. And then people started running and diving to the ground, crouching.\"Chávez was hurt in the stampede and had to take refuge in a local church.In Celaya, a city in Guanajuato, gunmen opened fire on a campaign event in April, killing a mayoral candidate and wounding three of her supporters.Saucedo, the analyst, sees the shootings as a sign that narco gangs are no longer willing to see their handpicked candidates lose.\"Rather than allow the victory of a candidate who is not in line with their criminal interests, or allow a candidate linked to a rival drug gang to win, they use this tactic,\" Saucedo said. \"What we\\'re seeing in the final stretch is pretty desperate strategy on the part of some groups of drug traffickers.\"Saucedo said that such attempts at narco-control of local politics had been seen previously in some particularly violent states, like Tamaulipas. \"What was once limited ... is now spreading to include the whole country,\" he said.The National Electoral Institute says it has had to cancel plans for 170 polling places, mostly in Chiapas and Michoacan and mostly because of security problems. In Chiapas, electoral authorities say there are places they can\\'t even go to.In the northern border city of Nuevo Laredo, a shadowy group that local media reports link to the dominant Northeast drug cartel has put up posters claiming one mayoral candidate is linked to the rival Gulf drug cartel.Authorities have not confirmed the origin of the crude poster, which includes a photoshopped image of the candidate waving an assault rifle and wearing a bulletproof vest with the Gulf cartel\\'s insignia.In the state of Morelos, just south of Mexico City, residents awoke this week to find a banner strung over a road claiming a gubernatorial candidate was tied to rival drug gangs. The banner was signed by a local drug boss whose name is unknown, \"the Commander of the Three Letters.\"Another apparently gang-related banner threatened that anyone trying to buy votes would be \"punished severely.\" That banner was signed by \"Those who have always called the shots here.\"Such events appear to indicate that past calculations by the cartels — take out the strongest candidate you don\\'t like, and the remaining major-party candidate will win by default — have become more complicated.In one town in Michoacan, Maravatio, the gangs apparently tried to eliminate any doubts as to who will win this year and killed off three candidates for town mayor who were not to their liking.'}\n",

At least seven other suspects were also detained.The Block of Popular Resistance and Rebellion — known as the BPR for its initials in Spanish — issued a statement saying Melara’s arrest \"is arbitrary and is an act of political persecution.\"The group demanded his release, and said \"we do not recognize the unconstitutional and illegitimate president who will take office on June 1.\" It said it would \"start an new stage of struggle in the face of Bukele’s imposition as president.\"In February, the highly popular Bukele easily won a second term in his country’s presidential elections, despite the country’s constitution prohibiting reelection.He has sparked criticism for his anti-gang raids and mass arrests, but the supposed bomb plot may have involved the terms of the 1992 peace accords that ended the civil war and guaranteed former rebels a place in politics.Bukele has made some moves that critics say endanger the Central American nation’s fragile democracy, which was restored after the brutal civil war.In addition to going after critics and locking up 1% of his country’s population in his gang crackdown, the leader last year also approved reforms slashing the number of seats in Congress, effectively weighting upcoming elections in his party’s favor.While it has involved allegations of abuse and unjust imprisonment, the gang crackdown has made Bukele popular; the country’s street gangs once essentially ruled many neighborhoods with brutality, killing and extorting money from almost everyone.Bukele not only won reelection. His party also won a super majority in Congress, effectively allowing him to rule with few checks on his power.'}\n",

The clicks are also used as a form of echolocation to help them track their prey.Scientists have been trying for decades to understand what those clicks might mean, with only minimal progress. While they still don\\'t know, they now think there are sets of clicks they believe make up a \"phonetic alphabet\" that the whales can use to build the very rough equivalent of what people think of as words and phrases.REAL LIFE DR. DOLITTLE? SCIENTISTS ON VERGE OF CRACKING CODE FOR TALKING TO ANIMALS\"We\\'re now starting to find the first building blocks of whale language,\" said David Gruber, founder and president of the Cetacean Translation Initiative or CETI, an effort devoted to translating the communication of sperm whales.In a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, researchers analyzed more than 8,700 snippets of sperm whale clicks, known as codas. They say they have found four basic components they think make up this phonetic alphabet.Pratyusha Sharma, the paper\\'s lead researcher, said this alphabet could then be used by the whales in an unlimited number of combinations.\"It doesn’t appear that they have a fixed set of codas,\" said Sharma, an artificial intelligence and computer science expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"That gives the whales access to a much larger communication system,\" she said, explaining it was as if the whales had a very large dictionary.Sperm whales have the biggest brains of any animal on the planet at up to 20 pounds, as much as six times the size of an average human brain. Thy live in matriarchal groups of about 10 and sometimes meet up with hundreds or thousands of other whales. Sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet long and dive to nearly 3,280 feet to hunt for squid. They sleep vertically, in groups.Gruber, a biology professor at the City University of New York, said sperm whales seem to have sophisticated social ties and deciphering their communication systems could reveal parallels with human language and society.To get enough examples of the sperm whale clicks in Dominica, where there is a resident population of about 200 whales, scientists created a giant underwater recording studio with microphones at different depths. Tags on the whales also record what position they are in when clicking — for example diving, sleeping, breathing at the surface — and if there are any other whales nearby they might be communicating with.Jeremy Goldbogen, an associate professor of oceans at Stanford University, called the new research \"extraordinary,\" saying it had \"vast implications for how we understand ocean giants.\"Goldbogen, who was not involved in the study, said that if we were one day able to understand what sperm whales were saying, that knowledge should be used for conservation purposes, like minimizing their risk of being hit by ships or reducing ocean noise levels.Sperm whales are classified as \" vulnerable \" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The whales were hunted for centuries for the oil contained in their giant heads and the species is still recovering.Diana Reiss, a marine mammal behavior and communication expert at the City University of New York, said that scientists understand certain aspects of marine animals\\' communication reasonably well, including the whistles used by dolphins and the songs sung by humpback whales.But when it comes to sperm whales, even that basic knowledge is lacking.\"What\\'s new in this study is that they are trying to look at the basis for the whales\\' communication system ... not just particular calls they\\'re making,\" she said.Reiss, who was not involved in the new research, said she hoped we would one day be able to match the whales’ clicks to behavior.\"We will never understand what the clicks mean to another whale, but we may be able to understand what the clicks mean enough to predict their behavior,\" she said. \"That alone would be an amazing achievement,\" she said.CETI founder Gruber said millions and possibly billions of whale codas would be needed to collect enough data to try to work out what the whales are saying, but he expects AI to help speed the analysis. He said other sperm whale populations — the whales are found in deep oceans from the Arctic to the Antarctic — likely communicate in slightly different ways.'}\n",

            "{'title': 'Can you bypass VPN blocks, protect your online privacy?', 'description': 'Kurt “CyberGuy\" Knutsson explains why someone could be blocking your access when using an VPN.', 'content': 'In today’s digital age, the significance of virtual private networks (VPNs) cannot be overstated. These powerful tools are essential for safeguarding your online activities and maintaining privacy against ever-evolving cyberthreats. Despite widespread recognition of their benefits, many users, like Beth, who recently contacted us, encounter challenges in effectively leveraging VPNs.\"Hi. I recently had some jerk hack my Amazon account and cause all sorts of problems and I believe they also hacked my Etsy account. … Anyway, I wanted to start using a VPN since 99% of my time both for work and at home is spent online and the same for my son and my husband. However, we noticed that a HUGE number of sites want to block people who are using VPNs. Do you have a suggestion for a VPN that is less likely to be blocked or noticed or however that works?\" —\\xa0Beth, Verbena, AlabamaHey Beth, I’m sorry to hear that you had to go through such an ordeal. It’s understandable that you want to protect your online privacy and security by using a VPN. However, it’s true that some websites block VPN connections to prevent fraudulent activities and protect their own security. Below are the reasons why VPN connections are blocked and how to circumvent that.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE NEWSLETTER, THE CYBERGUY REPORTMajor paid VPN services invest significant resources into evading VPN blocking by websites and services. Their server networks are large and constantly rotating IP addresses, making it harder to blacklist.Free VPN services tend to have smaller server networks and get their IP address ranges blacklisted more easily by anti-VPN measures. Paid providers are generally better at bypassing blocks.Many VPNs offer an obfuscation or camouflage mode that disguises VPN traffic as regular internet traffic, helping evade deep packet inspection used to identify VPNs.Some VPN providers offer browser extensions that can sometimes bypass VPN blocks when the desktop app fails. The extensions route only the browser traffic through the VPN.No VPN is 100% unblockable, but following these tips can help find a service that minimizes the chances of being blocked when trying to access restricted websites and services.MORE: HOW TO USE VPNs WITHOUT COMPROMISING YOUR BANKING APPSRegarding your online privacy, it’s true that companies like Google have been caught taking information they were not given permission to access. However, it’s important to note that websites have the right to block VPN connections if they suspect fraudulent activities. This is because VPNs can be used to mask the identity of the user and bypass geographical restrictions, which can be used for illegal activities. Below are the top four reasons VPN connections are blocked.1) Transparency: Financial institutions, in particular, often block VPNs because they want to preserve the transparency of transactions. In short, these institutions have a vested interest in seeing where and who the funds are coming and going. PayPal actually will go as far as to ban VPN users for life as it violates their Terms of Service agreements.2) Limiting services: Streaming services do not want users to use VPN because it bypasses specific region-based restrictions. Certain content is only available to specific regions of the world, and VPN would mask the user\\'s location.\\xa0Streaming services actively block VPN IP addresses, and if it is discovered you managed to bypass their IP blacklists with a regular VPN or VPN obfuscation, you can come under \"fire\" from the streaming services.3) Preventing illegal activities: Some governments and companies utilize VPN blocking to ensure that they are protected against misuse, fraud, and other illegal activities.4) Control: Some governments and companies use VPN blocking to monitor and trace back activities by individuals online. For instance, some companies ban VPN use, limiting nonwork access online, etc.ASK ANY TECH QUESTION AND GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER HEREMORE: HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOT SPOT PRIVACY, SECURITY WITH VPNOne effective way to bypass VPN blocking is to connect to a different VPN server location or city. Many websites and services that attempt to block VPNs do so by blacklisting known VPN IP address ranges. By switching to a VPN server in a different city or country, you can obtain a new IP address that may not be blocked.Most reputable VPN providers have a large global server network spanning hundreds or thousands of servers across dozens of countries. This gives you many options to try different server locations until you find one that is not blocked by the website or service you\\'re trying to access.The steps are usually:By changing your virtual location frequently, you make it much harder for anti-VPN measures to keep up with blacklisting all the IP addresses associated with a particular VPN service.Consider using a VPN to protect against being tracked and to identify your potential location on websites that you visit.\\xa0Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location. See my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.MORE: WILL A VPN PREVENT APPS FROM TRACKING ME?Given the tremendous amounts of personal data gleaned through daily online use, it is understandable why you might want to utilize a VPN service. Unfortunately, some companies and government agencies block VPN users, which is completely legal. While it is not foolproof and can slow down your connection speed, VPN obfuscation might help you continue to use VPN without getting blocked.Do you think the benefits of using a VPN outweigh the inconvenience of potentially being blocked by some websites?

Often overlooked, their contributions have come into sharper focus as the number of living D-Day veterans dwindles and the world prepares for the 80th anniversary of the landings.One of those women was Marie Scott, who was a 17-year-old radio operator when she heard the chaos of battle through her headset as she relayed messages between Allied commanders in England and men on the Normandy beaches.\"You realize the reality of war, what it really entails. It’s not a word. It’s an action that affects thousands, millions,\" Scott said recently, discussing her time in the Women’s Royal Naval Service, commonly known as the Wrens. \"I think I grew up that day from being a stupid 17-year-old. I think I honestly grew up on D-Day.\"Almost 160,000 Allied troops landed at Normandy on D-Day in a massive amphibious operation designed to break through heavily fortified German defenses and begin the liberation of Western Europe.Throughout the war, more than 1.1 million women served in the armed forces of the Western Allies, including 640,000 in Britain, where there was a real threat of invasion after Nazi troops drove to the shores of the English Channel.Even Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, did her bit, training to be a driver and mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the women’s branch of the British Army.The pitch on recruiting posters was simple: By joining the military and taking over support roles, women could free men for front-line service. Although technically barred from combat, more than 800 British women were killed in military service during the war.\"People forget they were 17, 18 doing these jobs,\" said Dick Goodwin, the honorary secretary of the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, which helps veterans travel to Normandy each year. \"I mean, it’s just amazing, really. Talk about thrown in at the deep end!\"Those who did not join the military had other opportunities to serve. Millions of women worked in defense factories, grew crops and rode motorcycles through the blacked out streets of London to keep firefighters updated on the latest bomb damage as the British government asked them to keep the economy going after men went off to fight.The Allied nations’ decision to mobilize women was an important strategic choice that contrasted with Nazi Germany, where the authorities relied on forced labor, according to Ian Johnson, a historian at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana.\"Part of the intent was to take it — use the economic and material advantages of the Allies and really … put that to greatest use compared to the way the Germans structured their military,\" he said. \"So those support roles were crucial in providing the logistical advantages that help the Allies win.\"Altogether, some 7 million British women served their country in some capacity during World War II.Their sacrifices are honored with a sculpture in central London, near the Cenotaph, the national war memorial.The bronze monolith is decorated with 17 different uniforms hung on pegs to represent the jobs women took on during the war, then gave up when the men returned.They include the uniforms of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and the Women’s Royal Naval Service. But there are also police overalls, a nursing cape and a welder’s mask.\"I get a certain satisfaction from my wartime experience,\" Scott said. \"And I do allow myself, occasionally, just a tinge of pride in my younger self.\"'}\n",

The money would have come from the Opioid Abatement Special Fund made up of Vermont\\'s share of a national settlement with drug manufacturers and distribution companies. Before then, the bill required the Health Department to contract with a researcher or consultant to study the impact of the overdose prevention center pilot program.The center would have provided referrals to addiction treatment as well as medical and social services. It would also have offered education about overdose prevention and distributed overdose reversal medications.Senate President Pro Tem Phil Baruth, a Democrat, said a statement on Thursday that \"the dramatic rise in fatal overdoses over the past ten years is one of the most pressing crises facing our state.\"He said overdose prevention centers save lives, connect people to treatment while reducing pressures on emergency departments and Emergency Medical Services and decreasing drug consumption in public.The governor vetoed a similar bill two years ago.'}\n",

            "{'title': 'How to easily start an outdoor exercise routine', 'description': 'For those who do not enjoy working out in a gym, exercising outdoors can make a great alternative. Plus, you get the added health benefits of spending time in nature.', 'content': 'Between the sweat smell, fluorescent lights and omnipresent television screens, April Herring has never connected with going to the gym.Instead, she runs, bikes, hikes, plays tennis, pickleball and football — anything to get her exercise outside as often as possible.\"Fresh air, sunshine, the variety of the trees as the seasons change,\" said Herring, an administrator at Carroll Community College in North Maryland. \"There’s something about the energetic healing quality of nature.\"GET THIS FITNESS GEAR THAT’S ACTUALLY COMFORTABLE TO WORKOUT INThe health benefits of spending time in nature have long been established, and exercise in general, of course, improves physical and mental well-being.Combine the two and you double down on what adults need to stay healthy, said Debbie Rhea, professor in kinesiology at Texas Christian University.\"We’ve got to get outside. We’ve got to be active,\" Rhea said. \"If we’re going to live long lives, this is what it’s about.\"Getting started on an outdoor routine, however, might not be as easy as signing up for another gym membership. Here’s how to get going.If you haven’t been active for a while, think back to the activities you enjoyed years ago, suggested Connie Sciolino, founder of the Alpine Training Center in Boulder, Colorado, a gym that trains athletes for outdoor mountain sports.People who like occasionally hiking or biking should start building an aerobic base by taking progressively longer walks or rides. Once you’re comfortably in the 35- to 45-minute range, start adding some intensity to build strength, she said.\"If jogging is their main activity, I would send them to the bleachers or do some up-down on stairs, either in sprint format or put a pack on their back,\" she said.Rhea cautioned against jumping back into a sport you used to play without preparing your body for the proper movement.\"Let’s say they’re in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and they haven’t sprinted and now they try to run around those bases,\" she said. \"They’re probably going to hurt an Achilles or a hamstring or something by doing something too fast.\"A side benefit of exercising outside is that there’s no need to buy expensive equipment, trainers say.After warming up with your preferred aerobic activity, add strength training by using your body weight and what is available in the built environment. That could be finding a picnic table or low wall and placing your hands shoulder-width apart to do leaning pushups. Then turn around, put your hands on the same surface and lower your body for dips that work your triceps.For working your legs, add squats with your feet shoulder-width apart, looking straight ahead with your back straight. Add lunges by taking giant steps and bending down into the space between your feet. For the core, find a patch of grass to do sit-ups.Start with eight to 10 repetitions, or no more than you are comfortable with, and add sets with short breaks in between as you get stronger.For a more complete workout, find a park or trail with outdoor exercise equipment, which is installed in one-third of park agencies, according to the National Recreation and Park Association. The equipment can range from basic pull-up bars to gym-style bench presses and rowing machines.And many cities, including Chicago, San Antonio and Atlanta, offer free group classes outdoors.When it inevitably rains or the weather turns colder, it helps to keep in mind an old axiom: There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.\"If we have the clothing for whatever the temperatures are that we may be in, then we’re more likely to go outside to be active when we need to,\" Rhea said.She suggested investing in a jacket that breathes and a light hat with a brim you can use on sunny or rainy days.Trainer Katie Higginbotham recommended having a contingency plan for inclement weather. Pick an area with surfaces that won’t get slippery when wet or somewhere with some tree shelter so as not to be bombarded by rain.On those days, having a regular exercise buddy really helps, said Higginbotham, who oversees quality control for TrainFitness, a U.K.-based private training provider.\"If you know someone is there waiting for you, it’s difficult to say no at the last minute,\" she said.Finally, it helps to set a goal, whether that is training for a 5K charity walk or a triathlon. If you’re working toward something, it keeps you motivated to keep going, Sciolino said.\"When you have that day marked on your calendar, you have to perform these things or die out there,\" she said.'}\n",

These synthetic substances might be more potent and addictive than traditional nicotine.', 'content': 'Nicotine alternatives used in vapes being launched in the U.S. and abroad, such as 6-methyl nicotine, may be more potent and addictive than nicotine itself, though the scientific data remains incomplete, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and independent researchers.The synthetic substances - which have a chemical structure similar to that of nicotine - are not subject to U.S. tobacco and vaping regulations that are designed to control traditional nicotine, a highly addictive drug.That means manufacturers can sell vapes containing synthetic nicotine analogues such as 6-methyl nicotine in the United States without seeking authorization from the FDA - a process that can be costly, time-consuming and is often unsuccessful.YOUNG VAPER WHO REQUIRED DOUBLE LUNG TRANSPLANT SHARES WARNINGS AS E-CIGARETTE SALES RISEBig tobacco firms like Altria Group and British American Tobacco have already lost substantial U.S. sales to an influx of disposable vapes containing traditional nicotine that are being illegally sold without FDA authorization.Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, highlighted the emerging use of 6-methyl nicotine in vapes and other smoking alternatives in a May 9 letter to the FDA, according to a copy of the correspondence posted on its website.It urged the agency to evaluate the compounds and establish what authority it had over them, warning they posed a \"new threat\" to regulation of the sector.\"The introduction and growth of chemicals intended to imitate the effects of nicotine, if left unchecked, could present unknown risks to U.S. consumers and undermine FDA’s authority,\" the letter said.SMOKING CIGARETTES CAN DESTROY LUNGS, BUT SHOCKING NEW STUDY REVEALS WHY VAPING CAN HARM THE HEARTIt cited SPREE BAR, a vape launched in October by Charlie\\'s Holdings Inc that uses 6-methyl nicotine.The FDA does not comment on its correspondence with individual firms.In response to Reuters\\' questions about 6-methyl nicotine and other nicotine alternatives, the FDA said in a statement: \"Although more research is needed, some emerging data show these nicotine analogs may be more potent than nicotine – which is already highly addictive, can alter adolescent brain development and have long-term effects on youth\\'s attention, learning and memory.\"Traditional nicotine found in many vapes and pouches is extracted from tobacco leaves. 6-methyl nicotine, in contrast, is made entirely in the lab using chemicals.The FDA said it was considering the use of such synthetic compounds from an \"agency-wide perspective\" and would use all of its resources to protect youth from products that may harm their health. As well as tobacco products, the FDA also regulates drugs, foods, cosmetics and more to ensure safety and efficacy.\"The FDA is a data-driven agency, and we\\'re in the process of reviewing the available data to inform potential actions in this space,\" it said in response to Reuters\\' questions.Three academic researchers told the news agency that current studies of 6-methyl nicotine are too limited to draw definite conclusions on the health impact or to what degree it is addictive.Imad Damaj, a professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University, said his research showed 6-methyl nicotine may be more potent than nicotine, but more extensive tests were needed to say what impact it has on humans.The limitations of existing research included that some papers were industry funded, while others focused on the short-term impact on animals or cells and were insufficient to understand 6-methyl nicotine\\'s effects on human bodies, the researchers said.Charlie\\'s Holdings calls the 6-methyl nicotine solution used in SPREE BAR Metatine. SPREE BAR\\'s website says Metatine \"may have a toxicity profile similar to nicotine\".SPREE BAR promises users 6,000 puffs from each device and offers fruity flavors including \"blue razz ice\" and \"creamy melon\", according to its website.The FDA has yet to approve any flavored vape using traditional nicotine for sale in the United States, saying companies have not been able to show that the health benefits they offer to smokers outweigh the known risks to young people, who may be more attracted by the flavors.Charlie\\'s Holdings co-founder Ryan Stump told Reuters that the company only targets adults, adding that flavors played an important role in its mission to help smokers quit cigarettes.Stump said Charlie\\'s Holdings respects and abides by laws in every market where it operates. He acknowledged that more research is needed on 6-methyl nicotine, adding that the company dilutes it in its products.US SCHOOLS INVEST MILLIONS IN SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY TO COMBAT TEEN VAPING EPIDEMICAnes Saleh sells SPREE BAR in his vape shop in Denver, Colorado, called Sultan Smoke. He said he has some customers who only buy Spree Bar instead of a nicotine vape and he hasn\\'t had any negative feedback on the product.\"The only... protest I would hear about people not wanting to try this is that they don\\'t know what Metatine is or does,\" he said.Stump said that Charlie\\'s Holdings is working on new varieties of SPREE BAR and new products using 6-methyl nicotine. It will launch SPREE BAR internationally this year. He declined to say where.The company buys the 6-methyl nicotine solution used in SPREE BAR from another U.S. firm, Novel Compounds, according to Novel Compounds\\' founder Samuel Benaim.Novel Compounds imports 6-methyl nicotine from overseas and alters it to make it easier for manufacturers like Charlie\\'s Holdings to use in their products. It sells this solution under the trade name imotine.Tests commissioned by Novel Compounds have found 6-methyl nicotine to be no more harmful than nicotine, Benaim said. But he also said that more research was needed into the chemical.Benaim added that Novel Compounds had received legal advice that its product is not classified as a tobacco product or drug in the United States. The company is committed to legal compliance, he said.Sven Jordt, a professor at Duke University, who has authored papers on products like SPREE BAR, said 6-methyl nicotine could me more addictive and toxic than its traditional cousin.\"Do we want to have such a chemical as a recreational product, available to anyone?,\" he asked. \"That\\'s really questionable.\"Neither Jordt nor Damaj - the professor at Virginia Commonwealth University - have received funding from tobacco or vape makers.As well as the United States, Novel Compounds also sells its 6-methyl nicotine solution around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, India and Japan.Another company, Aroma King, sells 6-methyl nicotine in the United Kingdom in pouches, which users insert under the lip to get a buzz. The pouches are sold in cans emblazoned with graphics of gorillas in suits and sunglasses.It said in a February blog post that its 6-methyl nicotine products were \"less toxic\", \"less harmful\", and \"less addictive\" than regular nicotine products.In a statement to Reuters, Aroma King cited existing research, its own toxicology and other tests and its supplier, which classifies 6-methyl nicotine as less toxic under the European Union\\'s Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP) Regulation.Aroma King said 6-methyl nicotine was self-classified by its supplier. It declined to say who supplies it with the chemical.Four Chinese companies hold patents in China related to the production of 6-methyl nicotine, including Zinwi Biotech, a company that makes the liquid used in vapes.Zinwi Biotech confirmed it is researching 6-methyl nicotine but did not answer further questions, including on whether it has sold any 6-methyl nicotine so far. Reuters was unable to find contact details for the other firms.'}\n",

Earth’s atmosphere is a blend of nitrogen, oxygen, argon and other gases.\"It’s probably the firmest evidence yet that this planet has an atmosphere,\" said Ian Crossfield, an astronomer at the University of Kansas who studies exoplanets and was not involved with the research.ASTRONOMERS DISCOVER SOLAR SYSTEM WITH 6 PLANETS IN PERFECT SYNCThe research was published in the journal Nature.Super Earth refers to a planet’s size — bigger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. The boiling temperatures on this planet — which can reach as hot as 4,200 degrees Fahrenheit – mean that it is unlikely to host life.Instead, scientists say the discovery is a promising sign that other such rocky planets with thick atmospheres could exist that may be more hospitable.The exoplanet 41 light years away is eight times heavier than Earth and circles its star Copernicus so closely that it has permanent day and night sides. A light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles. Its surface is encrusted with magma oceans.To identify the makeup of its atmosphere, researchers studied Webb Space Telescope observations before and after the planet passed behind its star.They separated the light emitted from the planet versus its star and used the data to calculate the planet\\'s temperature. There\\'s evidence the planet\\'s heat was being distributed more evenly across its surface – a party trick atmospheres are known for.Gases from its magma oceans may play a key role in holding its atmosphere steady. Exploring this super Earth may also yield clues to how Earth and Mars might have evolved first with magma oceans that have since cooled, scientists say.\"It’s a rare window,\" said Renyu Hu, a planetary scientist at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was part of the research. \"We can look into this early phase of planet evolution.\"'}\n",

But the most dangerous type is clear-air turbulence, which often occurs with no visible warning in the sky ahead.Clear-air turbulence happens most often in or near the high-altitude rivers of air called jet streams.The culprit is wind shear, which is when two huge air masses close to each other move at different speeds.If the difference in speed is big enough, the atmosphere can’t handle the strain, and it breaks into turbulent patterns like eddies in water.Turbulence-related fatalities are especially rare — particularly on a commercial flight.It can be tricky to predict, but experts stress that passengers' first line of defense is wearing a seat belt whenever possible.\"}\n",

Jump right in!Be sure to find a spot for sunscreen in your backpack. You're going to be spending the whole day, possibly multiple days, in the hot summer sun.\\xa0Even if you put on sunscreen in the morning before you go, you'll want to reapply throughout the day to ensure your skin doesn't burn.\\xa0Burnt shoulders will quickly make your day painful. If you don't have enough room in your bag for a full-sized bottle, you can always get a travel size instead.\\xa0Sunglasses are essential for a day at the theme park. You'll be spending the whole day outside, often stuck directly in the sun while waiting in line.\\xa0HOW TO WEAR SUNSCREEN THE RIGHT WAY: YOUR GUIDE TO SPFJust make sure not to leave your sunglasses on or on top of your head once you get on the ride, or else you'll likely lose them once it takes off.The best place to keep your sunglasses while you ride is safely tucked away in your bag or secured in a closed pocket.\\xa0When you're walking around with the heat surrounding you, a mini portable fan is going to save the day.\\xa0You can even get one that you wear around your neck if you don't want to hold it.\\xa0These fans are a perfect way to enjoy nice cool air as you make your way from ride to ride.\\xa0It's so important to stay hydrated while you are at an amusement park.\\xa0Collapsible water bottles are perhaps the best way to go, as they take up very little space in your bag.\\xa0Buying water at the parks is very expensive, so having your own bottle to refill will save you lots of money.HATE WATER?

This is such a small, easy item to add to your bag.\\xa0Make sure you have lip balm with SPF for extra sun protection.\\xa0Your hair is bound to be wind blown after a roller-coaster ride. Pack plenty of extra hairbands and clips. That way, you can tie up your hair quickly before you ride to avoid inevitable knots and tangles from leaving it down.\\xa0You're also probably going to want to tie up your hair after a few hours in the sun.\\xa0Accidents happen. If they do, you'll be prepared with Band-Aids packed neatly in your bag.\\xa0Blisters are common at amusement parks from walking around all day long.\\xa0Putting a Band-Aid over any blisters that form will keep you going through the day comfortably.\\xa0Check the weather forecast before you head to the park. If there's rain in the forecast, you're going to want a poncho.\\xa0Regular ponchos can take up a lot of space, but an individually wrapped poncho is slim and easy to fit into your bag.\\xa0Even if it's not going to rain, these are helpful to have on water rides, so your clothes don't get soaked.\\xa0This isn't an absolute necessity, as your phone battery is likely to be strong enough to last you the whole day.

These are great space savers, and you can also easily use your phone while it charges.\\xa0A sweatshirt isn't a necessity, since most likely, it'll be hot most of the day. Consider bringing a sweatshirt only if you plan on staying in the park late, as the temperature will cool as the sun goes down.\\xa0These are going to take up a lot of space, so if you're willing, it may just be easier to purchase a sweatshirt from the gift shop if you get cold at night.\\xa0If you're going to be visiting a water park during your travels, a waterproof phone case is going to come in handy.\\xa0One of the best you can get is a clear pouch that you simply place your phone in and secure shut.

The first is if you go on any water rides during your day in the park, such as a flume ride.If you're wearing socks and sneakers, and they get wet after a water ride, you're in for an uncomfortable rest of the day. Having an extra pair of socks to change into will make you a bit more comfortable.\\xa0Also, while walking around in hot temperatures, you're bound to get a little sweaty.

You can also clip a baseball hat right onto your bag to save space.\\xa0Plastic bags are a multi-use item that can be extremely helpful at amusement parks.\\xa0If you get a snack, like popcorn, that you don't finish in one sitting, don't throw it away. Instead, put the remainder in a plastic bag so you can snack on it later.\\xa0Plastic bags are also a great holder of cash, coins and credit cards if you don't want to bring a wallet with you.\\xa0Just in case anyone you are traveling with gets motion sickness from all the rides, having some remedies packed with you isn't a bad idea.\\xa0Dramamine, motion sickness patches or bracelets are all options.\\xa0This is definitely not a necessity and more of a helpful tool.\\xa0Placing a cooling towel around your neck can fill you with relief from hot temperatures.\\xa0These usually come in a tube or bag, so you can put the wet towel right back in its container before placing it in your backpack to prevent all your other items from getting wet.\\xa0For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.\"}\n",

Despite being a broke 25-year-old when I first visited 10 years ago, I will sing the destination’s praises until I lose my voice. Whether you’re looking for budget-friendly fun or a five-star sojourn (which I’m all about these days), Türkiye has it all. And thanks to\\xa0new nonstop flights from Detroit to Istanbul, it’s never been more accessible. Ideally, you can take a month off to criss-cross the country.

Closer to town, the dramatic Duden Waterfalls are a popular place to picnic. The Lower Falls even cascade over a cliff into the sea. Antalya, with its Roman, Ottoman Turkish, Seljuk Turkish, and Eastern Roman influences, doesn’t disappoint in the culture department either. Its 2,000-year-old Aspendos – the best preserved theater from the ancient world – still hosts concerts, operas, and ballets.

And such actions could well become a casus belli (an act that provokes a war),\" Medvedev said Friday, per Reuters.\\xa0Medvedev, who served as Russian president from 2008 and 2012,\\xa0said that the West’s ongoing support of Ukraine could lead to an escalation of the 27-month-old full-scale invasion.\"The current military conflict with the West is developing according to the worst possible scenario. There is a constant escalation when it comes to the firepower of NATO weapons being used. Therefore, nobody today can rule out the conflict\\'s transition to its final stage,\" Medvedev said.KYIV\\'S FORCES ARE UP AGAINST A CONCERTED RUSSIAN PUSH IN EASTERN UKRAINE, A MILITARY OFFICIAL SAYSThe comments come as depleted Ukrainian troops are losing ground in the war - and just weeks after the U.S. agreed to send an extra\\xa0$60 billion in aid to the war-torn country. In the border region of Kharkiv, Ukraine has\\xa0endured a Russian onslaught\\xa0this month that has stretched Kyiv’s outgunned and outmanned forces.The White House says that Russia’s forward progress has stalled and that Russia will not be able to capture Kharkiv.\\xa0Russia has only moved forward by a few kilometers and its forces are under relentless barrage by the Ukrainians and suffering at an extraordinary cost, the White House tells Fox News.\\xa0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that it\\'s only a matter of time before Ukraine utilizes the Western weaponry to strike Russian territory.The developments and threats of escalation came just weeks after Gen. Charles Brown, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said NATO military trainers will eventually be sent to Ukraine, according to a report in the New York Times.Ukrainian officials have asked their U.S. and NATO counterparts to help train 150,000 new recruits closer to the front line for faster deployment, per the report.\\xa0Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., told Fox News Digital at the time that deploying military trainers would lead to a wider war in the region.Friday\\'s comments by Medvedev are not the first time he has taken a hardline stance against the West. In January, he warned the\\xa0U.K.\\xa0that putting boots on the ground in Ukraine would amount to a declaration of war against Russia.In January, he also raised the prospect of nuclear war, warning NATO allies that a defeat for Russia in Ukraine could provoke a nuclear war.\\xa0\"The loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the beginning of a nuclear war,\" he said in a Telegram post.\"Nuclear powers have [never] lost major conflicts on which their fate depends,\" the Kremlin official added.\\xa0Fox News\\' Jennifer Griffin, as well as Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\\xa0'}\n",

Security Council has voted to end the U.N. political mission in Iraq; the mission was established in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion of the country that toppled Saddam Hussein.', 'content': 'The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday to end the U.N. political mission in Iraq established in 2003 following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein to coordinate post-conflict humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, and to help restore a representative government in the country.The Iraqi government asked the council in a May 8 letter to wrap up the mission by the end of 2025 and that’s what the resolution does: It extends the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, known as UNAMI, for a final 19 months until Dec. 31, 2025 when all its work will cease.IRAQ ASKS UN TO ABANDON POLITICAL MISSION IN BAGHDADThe U.S.-sponsored resolution asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to prepare \"a transition and liquidation plan\" in consultation with the Iraqi government by Dec. 31, 2024 so UNAMI can start transferring its tasks and withdrawing staff and assets.The council said it supports Iraq’s continuing stabilization efforts including its ongoing fight against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida extremists and their affiliates.In 2014, the Islamic State group declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria and attracted tens of thousands of supporters from around the world. The extremists were defeated by a U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria in 2019, but its sleeper cells remain in both countries.The council’s action came as Iraq is also seeking to wind down the military coalition formed to fight the IS. The roughly 2,500 U.S. troops are scattered around the country, largely in military installations in Baghdad and in the north. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has contended that the Iraqi security forces are capable of dealing with the remaining IS cells in the country and the coalition’s presence is no longer needed.The resolution adopted Friday to close the UNAMI mission expresses support for Iraq’s reform efforts aimed at fighting corruption, respecting and protecting human rights, delivering essential services to its people, creating jobs and diversifying the economy.It asks the secretary-general to streamline UNAMI’s tasks ahead of the mission’s closure to focus on providing advice, support and technical assistance to the government to strengthen preparations for free elections, including for the federal Parliament and for the Parliament in the Kurdistan region.It also authorizes UNAMI to facilitate progress toward finally resolving outstanding issues between Iraq and Kuwait, stemming from Saddam Hussein’s invasion of its smaller neighbor in August 1990.In addition, the resolution says UNAMI should help with the return of internally displaced Iraqis and those in Syria, with providing health care and other services and with economic development. And it also authorizes the mission to \"promote accountability and the protection of human rights, and judicial and legal reform.\"U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood welcomed the resolution’s unanimous adoption and plans for an orderly wind down of UNAMI.\"We all recognize that Iraq has changed dramatically in recent years and UNAMI’s mission needed to be realigned as part of our commitment to fostering a secure, stable and sovereign Iraq,\" he told the council.Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador Anna Evstigneeva stressed that what was important for Moscow in voting for the resolution was that the United States took into account the priorities Iraq wanted UNAMI to focus on in its final months.\"We are convinced that in the 20 years since its establishment UNAMI has fully realized its potential to assist in the restoration of Iraqi statehood and that the people of Iraq are now ready to assume full responsibility for the country’s political future,\" she said. \"We express our firm support for Iraq sovereignty and oppose any interference in the country’s internal affairs. That is an imperative.\"'}\n",

It cited Kim as saying that the drills \"will serve as an occasion in clearly showing what consequences our rivals will face if they provoke us.\"NORTH KOREA FIRES MISSILE BARRAGE OFF EASTERN COAST FOLLOWING FAILED SATELLITE LAUNCHPhotos showed Kim watching from a distance as at least 18 projectiles were launched.KCNA suggested the drills came as response to a South Korean aerial exercise performed hours before North Korea’s failed attempt to place its second spy satellite into orbit on Monday night.The launch attempt drew strong condemnation from South Korea, the U.S. and others because the U.N. bans any satellite launches by North Korea, viewing them as covers for testing missile technologies. North Korea reacted angrily, arguing that it has the sovereign right to launch satellites.Also this week, North Korea flew hundreds of huge balloons into South Korea carrying manure and other trash, and allegedly jammed GPS navigation signals in the South. There were no reports of any substantial damage.South Korea\\'s Unification Ministry responded in a statement Friday that North Korea must stop \"absurd, irrational provocations directed at us\" or face unspecified \"unbearable\" consequences. Ministry spokesperson Kim Inae said separately that South Korea \"strongly condemns\" North Korea for threatening preemptive strikes against the South.Observers speculate the South Korean retaliatory steps could include a resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea that include criticism of its human rights situation, world news and K-pop songs. North Korea is extremely sensitive to such broadcasts because most of its 26 million people are not allowed access to foreign TV and radio programs.The North Korean firing exercises appeared to be short-range ballistic missile test-launches that South Korea detected from North Korea\\'s capital region on Thursday. Experts say North Korea’s large artillery rockets blur the boundary between artillery systems and short-range ballistic missiles because they can create their own thrust and are guided during delivery.Since the start of 2022, North Korea has been engaged in a series of provocative weapons tests to increase its nuclear capabilities to cope with what it calls an intensifying U.S. military threat. Foreign experts say North Korea eventually aims to use its larger nuclear arsenal to wrest greater concessions from the U.S. when diplomacy resumes.'}\n",

Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, is just 12 miles from the Russian border.Ukrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.Russia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and Western Europe’s inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.The alliance is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and leaders will be meeting in Washington in July to reaffirm their support. Stoltenberg said he expects to be able to announce at the summit that at least two-thirds of members are meeting their commitment to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.'}\n",
